Basic vocabulary and sentence structures for use in essential daily-life situations, as well as cultural information, are taught through the course materials and assignments. Materials are web-based, with extensive use of Internet technologies for listening, reading, and communication. During regular semesters, this course is offered in a hybrid mode requiring one 80-minute class per week in addition to weekly 20-minute individual meetings with the instructor or a peer speaking assistant. There is a materials fee for taking this course which is paid by credit card on first log-in to the course website. A student with prior experience in French must take the placement exam.

Students will expand their interpersonal and presentational communication skills in both written and spoken French, improve reading and listening skills through various media so as to analyze content objectively, use appropriate vocabulary and grammar to express critical judgments, synthesize ideas from different source materials, and continue perfecting cultural analysis skills. Assignments will include using accepted academic conventions for research documentation and exposition. Social debates and current events will add a valuable perspective to our study.

We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own. The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community. Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each student's individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

This broad introductory course to general history through the prism of literature and politics aims at appreciating humanism and identity from the distant past on. 1. It discusses the significance of language and speech aptitude as a primordial and universal trait upon which rests the possibility of association and organization. This aptitude has made humans history conscious. 2. It explores some basic facts about the pre-19th century Western tradition of governance and the place of the individual within it, along with the expansion of these European states into the world in the aftermath of the maritime navigation and colonial conquest. An emphasis is placed on the pivotal European movements of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. The first, with its humanism in the 16th century, promoted a sense of identity associated with the language spoken in one\u00bfs area and the rise from the old medieval notion of suzerainty of the local gentry over local communities to the sovereignty of the monarchy of the area, thereby the nation state. The second, the 18th century Enlightenment, led to reforms and revolutions. These transformations, including the growth of literacy, have significantly marked Europe and subsequently the rest of the world that experienced European domination or influence. All this has resulted in the making of broad communities of European language speakers who are not of European descent.",

In this course we examine a wide selection of these tales for what they can reveal about Russian culture\u00bfs ethics, aesthetics, values and habits of mind. Students discover these through four analytical approaches: structural, psychological, feminist and socio-political. Attention is paid to the ways in which fairy tales hold sway in literature and the fine arts from centuries past right through to the present day. Course requirements include primary and secondary readings, oral presentations, written essays, tests and participation in class discussions.

You'll work on- or off- campus as an entry-level professional for 8-10 hours per week in a field of interest to you. You might, for example, intern with a local newspaper or magazine or radio or TV station, work for a publisher or political campaign, or do research and promotions for a non-profit agency associated with a cause you feel strongly about. Other possibilities include local hospitals, museums, theatre and other arts groups, software documentation firms and other groups needing technical writers and communications specialists, PR and ad agencies, law-related sites, and just about any place you can think of that requires writing and communication skills. Most of your class time for the course will be completed through work at your internship site a minimum of 120 hours (8-10 per week) over the semester for 9 units of credit. As the academic component of the course, you'll keep a reflective journal and meet periodically with the internship coordinator to discuss your internship and related professional issues. You will be responsible for finding your own internship, but it is recommended that you set up a meeting with the instructor to talk about your interests and what opportunities are open to you. You should do this before registration week.",

But what are we talking about, when we speak of \"rights\"? Or \"justice\"? Why do we assume that democracy is good? The ideas we invoke along the way \u2014 justice, equality, rights, democracy, progress \u2014 these are the subjects of political philosophy. In this seminar we will interrogate some of these ideas by examining traditions in Western political thought and the challenges to some of these traditions from more contemporary authors. We will begin by reading some classical texts in the social contract tradition, and dissents from anarchist, communist, and feminist thinkers. We will think about whether individuals do in fact or should have \"rights.\" We will read philosophical reflections on political revolutions and political change. We will investigate justifications for democratic government. Finally, we will turn out attention to some of the most pressing challenges of our age: multiculturalism, identity politics, and justice as it relates to race and gender.",

One such option is an internship, normally completed during the summer. Students do not need to officially register for an internship unless they want it listed on their official transcripts. CIT students interested in registering their internship for course credit on their transcript may enroll in this course. To do so, students must complete a CIT Internship form (located in Scaife Hall 110) and submit for approval. The CIT Undergraduate Studies Office will add the course to the student's schedule, and the student will be assessed tuition for 3 units. Upon completion of the internship, students must submit a 1-2 page report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the company supervisor to the CIT Undergraduate Office. After the reports has been reviewed and approved, a \"P\" grade will be assigned. This process should be used by international students interested in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or by any other engineering undergraduate wishing to have their internship experience reflected on their official University transcript. International students should also be authorized by the Office of International Education (OIE). More information regarding CPT is available on OIE's website.",
