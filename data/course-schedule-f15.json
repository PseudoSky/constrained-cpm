One such option is cooperative education, which provides a student with an extended period of exposure with a company. To participate, students must complete an ECE Co-op Approval form (located in HH 1115) and submit for approval. Students must possess at least junior status and have an overall grade point average of 3.0 or above. All co-ops must be approximately 8 months in uninterrupted length. If the co-op is approved, the ECE Undergraduate Studies Office will add the course to the student's schedule. Upon completion of the co-op experience, students must submit a 1-2 page report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the company supervisor to the ECE Undergraduate Office. International students should also be authorized by the Office of International Education (OIE). More information regarding CPT is available on OIE's website.",

The study of meaning in language, semantics, is a recently developed subfield of linguistics, since it presupposes advances in phonology, morphology, and syntactic structure. In addition, semantics faces the conceptual challenge of saying what meaning is. This course will reflect the history of semantics within linguistic theory and examine solutions to the problem of the definition of meaning. The course begins with the meanings of words and examines how these meanings combine to give the meanings of sentences, based on the notion of truth conditions for indicative sentences. That notion of meaning is then extended to sentences in other moods, and to sentences that do not simply describe how the world is, including sentences which are modal, conditional, or simply fictional. Semantics is a subject that can be developed in a highly formal way, but here it will be presented to make it accessible to students with varied backgrounds and interests. The components of the resulting theory will apply to any human language, and be an important component in the toolkit of any student of language.",

FALL 2015: This course will explore Latin American culture and language, focusing on issues of cultural identity. Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity, six periods will be identified as they are organized around crisis when the topic of \u00bfWho we are? becomes a central debate (Larra\u00edn 1996). These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the interwar period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships, and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and certain controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larra\u00edn 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. Three main questions will be discussed throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?, How does Latin America think of itself?, What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films, and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.",

Genomics combines experimental and computational approaches for large-scale analysis of the biological information contained in DNA sequences. The ability to analyze the complete DNA of any organism has revolutionized modern genetics and is influencing many areas of biology and medicine. The most abundant biological entities are bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). Their enormous diversity and number make bacteriophages important models for the study of gene structure, function and regulation, population genetics and evolution. In addition they are the source of important tools in biotechnology. The research goals of this course will be to identify new bacteriophage species and incorporate them into a comparative genomic study to better understand the genetic organization and evolution of these organisms. While accomplishing these goals students will develop an understanding of the research process, including the ability to design experiments and interpret novel data. Fall semester: Samples will be collected in the field. From these samples students will identify and purify bacteriophages. The bacteriophages will be characterized structurally by electron microscopy, and their DNA will be purified and sequenced.",

Within that framework, we explore strategies promoted within LEED and compare/contrast them with strategies in the rating systems of other countries. We also consider additional ways to encourage development of better buildings, e.g., codes and standards, incentives, and project delivery methods. The course focuses on the concepts underlying rating system credits, the national contexts that can produce different rating systems, and substantive improvement in building performance. This course provides the foundation for taking USGBC?s LEED Green Associate exam. More importantly, students who successfully complete the course will understand buildings? powerful impact on the environment and equally powerful strategies to address those impacts.

Reaction times in ironmaking and steelmaking process vary quite widely; the fundamental origins of the large differences in reaction time are analyzed, after a brief overview of the main reactions and process steps in ironmaking and steelmaking. Particular skills to be practiced and developed include derivation of the mathematical relationships which describe the rates of metallurgical processes which involve heat transfer, and mass transfer for solid-gas, liquid-gas and liquid-liquid reactions; quantifying the expected rates of such reactions; identification of rate-determining steps, based on calculated rates and observed reaction rates; predicting the effects of process parameters such as particle size, stirring, temperature and chemical compositions of phases on the overall rate; and critical evaluation of kinetic data and models in scientific papers on metallurgical reactions.",

In turn, biologists will obtain (a glimpse of) what quantitative tools can achieve beyond the mere collecting and archiving of facts in a universe of observations: By devising models, non-obvious quantitative predictions are derived which can be experimentally tested and may lead to threads that connect vastly different, apparently unrelated phenomena. One major goal is then to merge the two areas, physics an biology, in a unified perspective.",

The elementary school experience will involve regular visits, mentoring, and tutoring at school sites in the East End of Pittsburgh. The middle school experience provides opportunity for tutoring in Japanese, French, or Spanish at Barack Obama Academy of International Studies. The high school or middle school experience invites advanced students, majors, or minors in Chinese, French, German, Japanese, or Spanish to work with language students and teachers at local schools. During the early weeks of the semester, students will meet to arrange their community outreach activities and prepare for their experience. Depending on the number of units to be earned, students will spend a certain number of hours per week engaged in some of the following activities: attending and participating in the individual and group meetings, working in the schools four to six hours per week, reading and preparing for their volunteer activities, keeping a journal of their experiences and responses to course readings, writing a paper or completing a project at the end of the term that reflects experiences. The final course grade will be based on the student's participation at the school site and fulfillment of the plan set at the beginning of the semester, participation in weekly on-campus discussions, weekly journal submissions, and final synthesis project. Prerequisites: Permission of the faculty liaison plus completion of an information sheet available in the Department of Modern Languages, and clearance forms available through the Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning and Outreach.",

They also will learn the nomenclature used in molecular biology. In turn, biologists will obtain (a glimpse of) what quantitative tools can achieve beyond the mere collecting and archiving of facts in a universe of observations: By devising models, non-obvious quantitative predictions are derived which can be experimentally tested and may lead to threads that connect vastly different, apparently unrelated phenomena.

A primary theme of the course is the structural constituency of a sentence, and the course will address some of the following questions. What are syntactic constituents? Do all aspects of syntax manipulate the same kinds of structural units, or do different grammatical processes rest on incompatible notions of constituency? How do other syntactic relations connect with constituent structure? To the extent that there is mismatch between different notions of syntactic structure, how can it be reconciled within a theory of grammar? These questions are engaged in through the diagnostics and techniques of modern syntactic analysis and argumentation. Those tools will allow us to explore the striking ways in which syntactic theory unifies diverse grammatical phenomena in terms of a common notion of phrase structure. The course complements 80280, Linguistic Analysis, building on but not presupposing syntactic analyses developed in that class.",

This course is about making visual notes in order to become fluent in your abilities to observe, record and interperate. Through daily entries in a journal you will work in several content areas i.e. mapping, natural and built environments and systems to name a few. A good portion of the work in this class will be conducted in the field using the resources available to us such as the museum, zoo and architectural sites. You will also be challenged to incorporate your notes as tools for communicating design concepts, implementing project development and presentations. The course will rely on the use of a variety of simple drawing tools and electronic media.

And the media design process itself requires a sophisticated grasp of multiple layers of encoding and decoding technically, conceptually and experientially. This class is designed to give students a solid foundation in contemporary media design skills while simultaneously providing an examination of the function of theater historically and the ways media technologies fill those needs today. Early assignments focus on students\u00bf use of media in their everyday lives, by keeping media journals and bringing in media objects for examination. Later classes focus on taking ideas from this research and applying them in conceptual stage designs for an early Greek play, a contemporary adaptation and then a play of the students choosing. The class covers technical and conceptual basics from text analysis, research, storyboarding and analyzing dramatic structure to understanding screen/surface characteristics; video cue building; projection optics; and creating projection plots and other tools for communication with team members. Class assignments focus on the creation of dramatically relevant media-worlds and communicating these design ideas verbally, visually and in written documentation.",

The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.

In particular, we will explore the questions: What happens to scientific information and argument when they move from specialist journals into the mainstream media? In what ways might emotion and the character of the scientist influence scientific debates? What role do metaphor, analogy, and other stylistic features play in developing scientific thought and argument? And what role do visuals play in arguing science? To investigate these questions, we will be examining a broad range of real-world discourse from scientific journals to mainstream media and engaging with a broad range of scholarship in rhetoric, sociology, anthropology and philosophy of science.

After a brief discussion of the overall typological differences between the two languages and an initial training to analyze them cross-linguistically, it deals with specific areas of grammar that exhibit pervasive structural and semantic differences and serve as exercises for cross-linguistic analysis. On the basis of the discussions and exercises in class, students gather and analyze relevant Japanese data for their project, which facilitates their understanding of the grammar points and cultural ways of thinking in question, and develops their analytical skills.

Throughout, we will consider these questions from a cross-linguistic perspective, looking at morphological data from a wide range of languages. We will also consider how morphology interacts with other subfields of linguistics, including phonology, syntax and semantics.

One quarter of the nation's transportation companies went bankrupt, as did nearly 20,000 businesses. Unemployment reached 14%. Four years later it was officially declared a \"depression.\" When did all of this happen? Was it 2009? Or the 1930s? No, it was the depression triggered by the financial panic of 1873. Out of this period, also known as the \"Gilded Age,\" came a unique strain of American literature. Frank Norris's grisly tale of an overbearing dentist and his miserly wife, McTeague, Andrew Carnegie's autobiography, Upton Sinclair's iconic The Jungle, Edith Wharton's tragic love story House of Mirth, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's feminist utopian novel, Herland, William Dean Howell's capitalist satire, The Rise of Silas Lapham, Theodor Drieser's mournful Sister Carrie-all of these writings react to, and try to shape, the economy of a century ago. These novels, which were often critical of corporate capitalism, give us a rich and detailed picture of the last time in the US that Americans suffered under the kind of gap we have today between rich and poor. In the US today the top 1% controls 42% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 80% controls a mere 7% of the country's wealth. What can we learn about the present by reading the fictions of financial crisis and inequality in the past?",

Teams must work together to identify constraints and relationships between the unit operations they work on. Students must document implementation feasibility (cost, scheduling, analytic capability, etc.) and clearly identify the criteria and methods for assessing experimental results. Oral and written reports are required.",

A recurring picture of the \"American Dream\" has typically included the image of a single-family, detached dwelling set within its own green yard in the suburbs. However powerful and durable that image is, the history of house and home in America is actually a far more complex story with many different twists and turns. In the course we will look at both urban and suburban housing choices and cultures, ranging from single family detached dwellings to multi-unit housing, and across a social spectrum income, class, race, and gender. Through the use of occasional field trips, we will use Pittsburgh as a touchstone for understanding broader national trends in the history of American urban and suburban housing. The course is organized as a lecture course supplemented with field trips and discussions based on field trips and primary source readings. The additional time slot on Thursday afternoons will be used only when field trips are scheduled. Student work will include a research paper and several shorter written assignments throughout the semester.",

The emphasis is on process, not product \u2014 devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development \u2014 both of which are explored here. We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included: Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more. Students learn to define and distinguish these artist's approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion. This class is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline. We focus on the process of creating a theatrical language which truly integrates disciplines.",

As Joyce Carol Oates wrote in the foreword to her book-length essay on the sport, boxing forces us to contemplate not only boxing, \"but the perimeters of civilization ? what it is, or should be, to be ?human.\" We?ll read Oates? book On Boxing, and many other works, among them the novel Fat City, and The Sweetest Thing, a memoir by a woman boxer.

You must then be prepared to negotiate with others to get your job done, to advance your career, and even to maintain meaningful personal relationships with your family and friends. The purpose of this course is to help prepare you for these negotiations. In particular, in this course, you will reflect on your current approaches to conflict, study the nature of conflict and why it tends to escalate, and develop your own skills for principled negotiation. Throughout the course you will also participate in negotiation simulations exercising your powers of communication and persuasion while practicing conflict resolution tactics. My goal is that you finish this course a more reflective and effective negotiator, better prepared to handle the conflicts you will inevitably face.",

The investor's perspective (supply) requires the use a set of tools to evaluate, structure and price financing deals. The tools include discounted cash flow, the VC method, comparables analysis and real options.

While such expectations exist, practice in this genre of writing, particularly in the personal statement, is not always readily available in existing coursework. \"Presenting a Public Self\" will introduce methods for developing and practicing your ability to communicate individual proficiencies and aspirations in written form, while bringing you in contact with a body of published work by public intellectual figures from the U.S. and other territories whose writing demonstrates an intertwining of personal narrative and public, professional identity, to engage readers of all stripes. Throughout the term you will practice writing in the public yet personal vein through assignments like: self-portrait essay, to cultivate a first-person voice, an op-ed essay, to practice balance in argument from the position of a burgeoning expert in your disciplinary area, and a personal statement, where you will learn to combine articulation of a personal narrative and professional competency to argue why you are a strong candidate for a particular opportunity. Reading selections for the semester will include work produced by your peers, as well as published writers whose work combines personal and professional spheres, ranging from texts like Paul John Eakin's Living Autobiographically to Mary Catherine Bateson's Composing a Life to Spencer Nadler's The Language of Cells: A Doctor and his Patients, amongst others.",

            "desc": "Would coming to CMU and not studying Shakespeare seem like going to the Sistine Chapel and not looking up? In 1878, Andrew Carnegie left his growing steel empire to sail around the world. Content to leave his business, he was not content to leave his 13-volume set of Shakespeare?s complete works. He later wrote: \"I have read carefully eleven of Shakespeare's plays during the spare hours of the voyage?They are such gems. I?feel as if I have made new friends, whose angel visits will do me good in days and nights to come?..every thing has its 'environment,' and Shakespeare is the environment of all English-speaking men.\" Much has changed since Carnegie wrote those words, as Joss Whedon's film of Much Ado About Nothing, for example, can attest. But many still hunger for an introductory course like this one course on \"the Bard.\" Our reading list will include famous and exuberant plays such as Much Ado, A Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, Measure for Measure, Pericles, Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest. Othello, a tragedy, will help us give focused attention to questions of genre by way of counterpoint. Plots, jokes, conventions, and contexts - we?ll discuss them all. Students at the end of the course should expect to have a good grounding in the language, themes, and characters of Shakespearean comedy and romance and perhaps more importantly be equipped to think carefully about Shakespeare's plays in relation to poetics, history, politics, and genre. In addition to regular short writing exercises of varying types, assignments will include one close reading paper, a longer research paper, and performance of a scene.",

Speculate upon the potential application of the results at the building scale. Our work will leverage the robustness and precision of industrial robotic arms in conjunction with rule-based, computationally generated geometry to explore highly customizable alternatives to long-standing massproduction metal forming techniques.

In this course, designed for students pursuing careers in professional communication, we'll examine the critically important practices of argument and advocacy. And while our central focus will be on non-profits, the arts, education, political advocacy and social causes, the techniques we'll learn are also broadly applicable to communications careers in all sectors. Our main focus will be on how professional communicators design arguments and make media choices consistent with the \"voice\" of their organizations. Among other questions, we will ask, how can we adapt the genres of mass communication to meet our organization's goals? What roles can social media play in non-profit advocacy, and how are those roles changing? How can we have impact while working with limited budgets? The end result will be a professional portfolio that demonstrates both relevant skills and a high-level theoretical understanding of what makes a public argument successful. Students will also gain experience in translating their technical expertise into language that potential employers understand and look for.",

Most of your class time for the course will be completed through work at your internship site a minimum of 120 hours (8-10 per week) over the semester for 9 units of credit. As the academic component of the course, you'll keep a reflective journal and meet periodically with the internship coordinator to discuss your internship and related professional issues.

This course provides a systematic investigation of the way such questions are answered by dominant schools of liberal political theory, such as the social contract tradition, utilitarianism and libertarianism. Because the liberal political tradition is also strongly egalitarian in nature, the course will examine different conceptions of political equality and conflicting views about the respects in which community members may have a just claim to equal treatment. Readings are drawn from classic works by authors such as Hobbes, Locke, Kant, and Mill, and from the works of contemporary theorists like Rawls, Nozick and others.",

This course will engage students in the metrics and impacts of our collective consumption and waste of: -Energy -Materials (Cradle to Cradle) -Food -Water -Transportation -The Integration of Systems towards Quality of Life Starting at the global context, this course will address challenges/opportunities to advance regenerative practices, improving our relationship to nature. Learning from international best practices, we will continue to explore ecological footprints at the global, national, regional, city, neighborhood, building and individual scale. The course will be based on lectures and readings, with assignments and student presentations to fully explore each of the footprint characteristics. Experts on water, energy, materials, food and other resources have been invited to lecture. By mid semester, an application project will be selected for ecological footprint analysis and the development of design, engineering, and operational guidelines towards reducing that footprint. The potential application projects include: the CMU campus footprint and Donner House retrofit; the Energy Innovation Center and education of the trades in reducing our regions footprint; or a new Net Zero building for Carnegie Mellon University.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs\u2014-that is, as a function. But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values. This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type. One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function. Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation. NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer Science course.",

In this course, we will use the emerging field of social networks to put structure on this diverse mass of connections. Using a mixture of theoretical, empirical, and computational methods, we will learn about the structure and function of social networks. We will look at how an individual's position in a social network reflects her role in the community. We will learn to identify tastemakers and trendsetters by looking at how information moves through our increasingly connected society. We will consider how our own position in the social network affects our behavior, opinions, and outcomes. And we will explore where social networks come from, and what affects their structure. The material in this course will be interdisciplinary, drawn from the fields of math, computer science, physics, sociology, political science, and economics. By the end of the course, you will have the tools and knowledge needed to analyze social networks on your own. The course is capped with a project where you will use your skills to answer your own questions.",

Typical assignments include resumes, instructions, proposals, and adaptations of specialized information for non-expert audiences. At least one of the assignments will be a group project. As a final project, you?ll create a portfolio of polished writing samples that you can use in applying for internships and employment. The range of assignments in the course is designed to give you experience with a variety of writing situations that professional writers frequently encounter. The assignments also reflect options for specialization that you may wish to pursue in future coursework and in your career as a professional writer. As you work through the assignments, you should learn both current conventions for the kinds of writing you?ll be doing and a broadly applicable procedure for analyzing novel situations and adapting conventional forms (and creating new ones) to meet the unique demands of each new situation and task.

It is widely recognized as a beautiful theory - equating gravity and the geometry of spacetime leads to a profound conceptual change in the way we regard the universe. The predictions of the theory are relevant to systems as varied as high precision measurements of the earth's gravitational field or the strongly curved space-times around black holes. In this course, we will gradually develop an understanding of the geometries which are the solutions of the Einstein equation, with an emphasis on their relevance to physical situations. We will motivate the theory step by step and eventually introduce the Einstein equation itself. Typical Textbook(s): \"Gravity, An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity\" by James Hartle.",

Expanded Theater will reanimate classical modes of performance with media, networks, robotics, locative applications, and mobile systems. Considering theater as an ancient technology of mass participation and social cohesion, this fusion studio explores how emerging technologies can expand upon the basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways. Collaboration and integration of design, media and storytelling is critical to this approach. Experimentation with new forms can reanimate the basic values of theater; the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience. Expanded Theater is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional theatrical production modes and beyond each student\u00bfs individual discipline. The curriculum combines resources from Carnegie Mellon\u00bfs Schools of Art and Drama, Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe), the Emerging Media Masters (EM2), Computer Science, the Robotics Institute, and their collaborators across the university in a new configuration. Expanded Theater will explore domains ranging from site specific and networked-based performance and interventionist practices, to pervasive social media technologies and their influence on interpersonal communication. The goal is to investigate contemporary languages that allow authors, actors and technologists to collaborate in ways that push beyond our present understanding of theatrical production and reception.",

Material will be presented on a level intended for upper-level science and engineering students. The course will start with a brief review of the physical principles of electric fields and forces, the nature of chemical bonds, the interaction of light with matter, and elastic deformation of solids. Characterization using electron microscopy, scanning probe methods, and spectroscopic techniques will then be described in detail. Fabrication using top-down and bottom-up methods will be discussed, contrasting these approaches and providing examples of each. Nanotechnology methods will be compared with those used in the modern micro-electronics industry. Finally, examples of nanoscale components and systems will be described, including quantum dots, self-assembled monolayers, molecular computing, and others. Stand-alone laboratory exercises will be included as an important element of the course. These will focus on the use of scanning probe methods to study the nm-scale structure and atomic forces involved in various nanostructures. Students will sign up for these laboratory sessions and perform the exercises under the supervision of a teaching assistant. In addition to the prerequisites, students should have taken a prior laboratory course in a science or engineering department and should have some familiarity with differential equations at an elementary level.",

The course uses lectures, readings, group exercises, and an individual project with instructor feedback to achieve the learning objectives. The primary work in this course is hands-on application of the material by the student to create a strategic marketing plan for their own, approved product innovation idea with evaluation and feedback from the instructor. A customer-centric orientation is emphasized throughout the course. The course addresses strategic marketing decisions and activities including identifying value creation opportunities; generating and selecting innovation ideas; understanding the market, competition, customer needs and customer experience; segmenting, targeting markets; developing a positioning strategy and compelling customer value proposition; making marketing-mix decisions for product, pricing, route-to-market/distribution, and customer base development. The perspective of this course will be from a role of a strategic marketer, which is typically held by an entrepreneur/CEO, product manager, strategic marketing manager, product planning manager, new business development manager, or innovation manager.

Such systems include digital+physical toys and gadgets, kinetic sculpture, functional sensing and assessment tools, mobile instruments, interactive wearables, etc. This is a project-based course that deals with all aspects of conceiving, designing and developing projects with physical computing: the application, the artifact, the computer-aided design environment, and the physical prototyping facilities. The class consists of students from different disciplines who collaboratively synthesize and implement several systems in a short period of time. The course is organized around a large set of essential skills that students must gain in order to effectively tackle physical computing problems. It is then deployed through a series of quick group projects that utilize the essential skills and challenge students to not only consider HOW to make things, but also for WHOM we design, WHEN the time is ripe, and WHY the making is worthwhile/necessary. Upon completion of this course the students will be able to: work in a mixed physical-digital environment and laboratory, make effective use of standard hardware and software tools for physical computing, approach complex physical computing problems with a systematic overview that integrates iterative research and design steps, generate systems specifications from a perceived need, partition functionality between hardware and software, produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems, use computer-aided development tools for design, fabrication and testing and debugging, evaluate the system in the context of an end user application or experience.

Examples include the Shia-Sunni schism or split that has divided Islamdom since the first decades after the death of the Prophet founder in 632; the tensions between unity and sectarianism that relentlessly explode in Muslim countries; the persisting questions of equality and inequality that pertain to gender and race. The works of such historians as Muhammad ibn Ishaq of Medina (704-769), who authored an early biography (Sirat Rasul Allah,Life of the Messenger of Allah), Muhammad ibn Saad of Basra (764-845), who was inspired by Ibn Ishaq, the historian Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir Al-Tabari (839-923), who authored the multi-volume Tarikh al-rasul wa al muluk (History of the Prophets and Kings),and the 14th-century eminent thinker, Abu Zayd Muhammad Ibn Khaldun, who wrote the Muqaddimah, an Introduction to History, and numerous contemporary scholars help to elucidate part of the problems. Exploring these texts improves the students' grasp of history. This course will be taught as a proseminar that aims at introducing the literature in the English translation and at raising questions. It will broaden deepen the appreciation of history by undergraduate students. As a \"specialized\" offering reserved for students minoring in history or having successfully completed two courses in history or having the authorization of the instructor, it will meet once a week for 2 and half hours and will discuss at length the sources and the questions.",

This course assumes that the public policy landscape is complex but still comprehensible given the proper set of analytical frameworks and appropriate historical background. Particular emphasis will be placed on: changing views about the authority of the government to intervene in economic and social issues; the best way to balance individual and collective interests; and the variability within society of the life courses of individuals.

This course does not teach how to read or write Arabic. It offers students the opportunity to engage in conversation that expands on the linguistic topics offered in Arabic for Global Exchange, using a spoken Arabic that would be widely understood anywhere in the Arab World. The conversation topics include greetings, explaining one's background, formal and informal meetings, eating out and ordering food, shopping and bargaining, using transportation, expressing feelings and opinions, describing things, people, and hobbies, and in addition, students will learn common expressions and their uses.

The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them. To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking, and managing impressions. Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work. Readings come from both the research and the managerial literatures. Among the topics considered are managerial communication, persuasion and conformity, self presentation and person perception, social networks.

It is intended for women only because it is believed that the presence of males in class (other than instructors or other authorized persons) can alter the emotional and physical responses of women to class material and thereby hinder their ability to reach course objectives. It is of the utmost importance that women be able to maximize their opportunity to learn in the company of like-minded students. The core of the course is based upon the principles of the Rape Aggression Defense System (R.A.D.)which was conceived and developed by Larry N. Nadeau. His goal in developing R.A.D. is also its motto: \"To develop and enhance the options of self-defense, so they may become viable considerations to the woman who is attacked.\" This course is composed of three sections: risk reduction principles, physical defense techniques, and simulation. Risk reduction principles include a thorough review of personal self-awareness & the environment, whether in the home, neighborhood, or unfamiliar community. Physical defense techniques include the introduction to bodily strikes with hands, kicks with the feet, and defenses against grabs & holds. Simulation is the activity that attempts to incorporate, via physical demonstration, all emotional & physical techniques that have been taught through the acting out of scenarios involving instructors (padded/protected) as attackers, and students (padded/protected) responding to the assault.",

The aim of this seminar is to generate a comprehensive knowledge of key works, delineate trajectories, acknowledge blind-spots, and critically scrutinize the key figures and intellectual history of American literary and cultural criticism. The primary works in this class will be big and rather challenging works of literary criticism and theory accompanied by a smattering of novels and poems. The first part of this course will focus on the critics, poets, novelists and interpretive trends that defined American literary and cultural criticism up until World War II. Some of the authors we will read include: Williams Dean Howells, Van Wyck Brooks, Mark Twain, W.E.B. Dubois, Alain Locke, William Carlos Williams, John Crowe Ransom, Robert Penn Warren, Alfred Kazin and F.O. Matthiessen.",

The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic. Presentation: The material is presented on-line, though some exercises must be done with pen and paper. Additional reading of historical and philosophical character complements the systematic on-line presentation. Weekly small discussion meetings with collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections supplement the on-line material.",

What does the medium in which a text is presented?the book, or film, or painting, or theatrical performance?have to do with how the text is received, consumed, contested, or appropriated, sometimes or often against the intentions of the author, painter, or performer? This course studies the long-debated problem of how readers or spectators respond to texts (in print, film, theater or painting) from ancient rhetoric and tragedy to contemporary mass culture. Aristotle, Plato, Longinus and other ancients theorized about audience response in terms of its danger or advantage to the polis; in that broad sense, the problem has always been political as well as psychological and aesthetic. Eighteenth-century thinkers formulated notions of 'beauty' and 'standards of taste' to measure audience response to poetry and visual art. Romantic writers developed psychologies of reading as symbolic interpretation. The rise of mass culture, on the other hand, links the politics of reading or viewing to questions of consumption and the market of cultural goods. Guided by recent critical theory as well as classic questions, we will ask how the reading or viewing subject is 'constructed' by the printed or filmic text; how institutions like schools control the process of interpretation; how individual readers 'appropriate' texts for themselves against their authors? intentions. Two shorter papers and one longer paper will be required for the course, in addition to a class presentation in the last two weeks of the semester.

What is a fair price or wage? By looking at specific cases in different phases of Chinese history, from ancient philosophy to contemporary literature and language, students will also be able to gain insights into the various academic disciplines that make up the humanities including philosophy, history, archeology, anthropology, literature, economic history, religious studies, and linguistics.

For a sparsely populated region lying atop the Himalayan Mountain Range, Tibet has long held a remarkable hold on the imaginations of outside observers. In this class, we will go beyond the many mythologies and stereotypes that have shaped perceptions of Tibet and Tibetans. Alongside the chronology of Tibetan history, we will investigate what it is that makes Tibetan civilization distinct. We will pay close attention to the foundations and development of Tibetan Buddhism and examine its centrality not only to the social, economic and spiritual life of Tibetans but also in the development of Tibet's unique political culture, including the institution of the Dalai Lama. Other themes will include Tibet's relationship to the surrounding civilizations of eastern, southern and inner Asia; western imperialism and western fascination with Tibet; and Tibet's incorporation into the modern Chinese state. We will also address the current controversy over Tibet's international status, the prospects for a political solution, and the state of Tibetan civilization in the twenty-first century. Finally, we will consider Tibet's continuing ability to capture the imagination of peoples around the world.",

It is intended for seniors who are eager to creatively apply their learned knowledge skills, and who are interested in invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship. The first half (part 1 (19461), mini 1) will focus on the process of invention for devices and technologies that are enabled by materials functionality. This will start by providing historical context and addressing the questions \"What is invention?\" This will be followed by an assessment of various systematic methods by which the process of invention is practiced, with a specific focus on materials intensive devices and products. The second half of the course (part 2 (19462), mini 2) will examine innovation theory in the context of materials intensive technologies.

Because the key to learning to write effectively is to practice the necessary skills, class emphasis - and much of your grade - will be based on seven writing assignments involving current events and covering various types of news writing. Through readings, assignments and class discussion, we'll tackle questions such as: What makes a story newsworthy? How does a reporter decide which points to emphasize? What are effective techniques for a successful interview? How does a journalist turn pages of scribbled notes into a coherent news story? We'll do a lot of writing, but we'll also examine issues and trends affecting journalism today. We'll cover at least two live events and hear from local professionals about working in print, broadcast and public relations. We'll also look at how newer mediums - such as blogs, the internet, and cable news - shape and influence news reporting.",

The students will be exposed to a variety of formalized invention and innovation processes/concepts and will be asked to complete projects that will pull from the full range of their engineering training. It is intended for seniors who are eager to creatively apply their learned knowledge skills, and who are interested in invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship. The first half (part 1 (27-501), mini 1) will focus on the process of invention for devices and technologies that are enabled by materials functionality. This will start by providing historical context and addressing the questions \"What is invention?\" This will be followed by an assessment of various systematic methods by which the process of invention is practiced, with a specific focus on materials intensive devices and products. The second half of the course (part 2 (27-502) mini 2) will examine innovation theory in the context of materials intensive technologies. Specifically, the concepts of incumbency, disruption, value chain, supply chain, funding models and paths to market will be addressed. In this class, significant time will be dedicated to covering the impact of international market and technology development.",

The question is what are these funders looking for in an early stage investment? What is important to them? How do they decide which companies to invest in and which not? This class looks at funding from the funder's point of view and provides the student with a framework of the investment process: investment criteria, sourcing, selection, due diligence, deal structure, valuation, post investment involvement. Real companies seeking funding are used for the final project in which students will be expected, as investment teams, to make investment decisions and convince their fellow investors (the class) to join them (or not). This is a highly interactive and project class. There will be multiple guest speakers. Prerequisites: Students are highly encouraged to take any of the introductory entrepreneurship classes offered in various schools and departments. While no financial background is required, this class will not cover the basics of entrepreneurship from the entrepreneur's perspective, but will be looking from the investor point of view.",

The course will trace the historical trajectories of these groups, both those dating back centuries, such as Mexican-Americans and certain Caribbean populations, and those with more recent, quickly growing populations, such as Salvadoran and Honduran immigrants, or \u00bfCentral-American Americans\u00bf, in an effort to understand how their identities are forged and transformed over time, considering both internal and external perspectives. Students will examine key moments in each group's history, drawing on materials from a variety of disciplines and sources including but not limited to film, literature, oral histories, newspapers articles, as well as theoretical articles that explore questions of identity, to compare and to contrast their diverse experiences. The course will include discussions and debates on the multiple factors that affect U.S. Latino populations, including for example, U.S. immigration policy, political and economic events in Latin America and the U.S. Further, we will consider the interplay of issues such as race, class, gender and sexuality, in the formation of U.S. Latino identities.

This will be accomplished through an extra 50 minute lecture period, where more advanced topics and applications will be discussed. Topics will include computational chemistry, green chemistry, chiral separations, photochemistry, reaction kinetics, controlled radical polymerizations and petroleum cracking. Students who complete 09-219 will have a strong foundation in organic chemistry as well as a sophisticated understanding of how organic chemistry is currently practiced. 4 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec.",

We study the many ways that individuals constructed and used their religious identities to approach problems of public life. We examine continuities and changes in religious institutions as well as conflicts between churches and states. The course shows that, far from declining in importance during the processes of economic and political modernization, or becoming part of private life, religious beliefs and identities played an increasingly critical role in public life. We approach the topic through case studies, beginning with the religious conflicts and settlement between church and state during the French revolution, Evangelical Christian participation in the anti-slavery movement in Britain, Protestant-Catholic rivalries in Germany, the power of the papacy in Italy, and the Dreyfus case in France. Students will have reading assignments from both primary and secondary sources.",

This phenomenon finds important application in the biological and medicinal field where dyes are used as molecular tools. For example, fluorescent dyes can be used to detect the expression of a gene; survival of cells; site of accumulation of a metabolite and many of them are used in diagnostics. This course is aimed at offering a hands-on laboratory experience in the interface of chemistry and biology, so called bioorganic chemistry. The student's project will be to prepare a dye, thiazole orange, that will show increased fluorescence upon binding DNA or a protein, thus, signaling the binding event. A dye designed to prevent DNA binding will be tested alongside to highlight how molecular design works. Molecular size and geometry are important elements in the design of molecules that specifically bind biological targets; 3D molecular modeling software (freeware) and hand-held models will be used to analyze how these factors play a role in target-dye interaction.",

This introduction to the rhetoric of making a difference shows how its roots in American philosophical pragmatism created a focus on outcomes, not just ideals, and translated commitments into strategic rhetorical practices. In this course you will develop your own skills in writing and leadership by working as a \"rhetorical consultant\" to a campus or community group: learning how to investigate and define a shared problem, to develop a briefing book for deliberation, and to support inclusive decision making by documenting rival perspectives and options (see http://www.cmu.edu/thinktank).

            "desc": "The purpose of this course is to introduce you to diverse examples of literary, cinematic and musical expression centered on or created by the women and men of the African diaspora. This particular version of the class will concern itself with the very fraught and at times incommensurate relationship between politics, protest and art. The tragic deaths of Michael Brown, Renisha McBride and Eric Garner have illuminated the way Web 2.0 continues to play a crucial role in the organization of political protest (for instance through the hashtag #blacklivesmatter) as well as a representational war of position concerning how Brown, McBride and Garner were represented to the public sphere. Through a variety of media forms like the novel, television, cinema, music and the Web this class will take a historical view on our current politics of organization and representation starting with the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements of the 1960s and end roughly with the events in Ferguson, Missouri. You will read, listen or watch the works of James Baldwin, Amiri Baraka, Toni Morrison, Spike Lee, Aaron McGruder, Justin Simien, Ava DuVernay, Kara Walker and N.W.A. to name just a few of the artists we will discuss in this class Along with these primary works this course will also introduce you secondary readings that will help you explore the historical, aesthetic and political issues that surround these works of art, give you a sense of how criticism functions and the multitude of forms criticism can take.",

The objectives of this course are to help students develop a critical approach to the evaluation of study designs, data and results, and to develop skills in the application of basic statistical methods in empirical research. An important feature of the course will be the use of the computer to facilitate the understanding of important statistical ideas and for the implementation of data analysis. In addition to three lectures a week, students will attend a computer lab once a week. Examples will be drawn from areas of applications of particular interest to H&SS students.

I find [novels]...in the work-bag of the seamstress, in the hands of the lady who lounges on the sofa, the mistresses of nobles, the mistresses of snuff-shops, the belles who read them in town, and the chits who spell them in the country.\" While today we might be genuinely concerned about texting while driving, or the depression associated with high levels of facebook use, in this class we won't judge so much as we will analyze. We will look at what historical media trends have in common with, and how they are different from, the media trends of today. We will read about the print revolution, the electronic media revolution, the current digital revolution, and we will also try to peer into the future. Importantly, we will take a literary and cultural studies approach to this material. We will ask, specifically, what can the humanities teach us about media revolutions over time? How is narrative, or story telling, central to each media revolution?

Lewis, Malcolm X, and Philip Pullman. This course will investigate what has made Milton a writer at once so much imitated and beloved by his admirers and loathed and denigrated by detractors.

Studying Milton's development as a poet, controversialist, and pamphleteer, students will examine Milton's contexts (chiefly, literary, political, and theological) in order gain further insights into the complex relations between Milton's 17th century world and his major poems and prose. Milton's works will be read in dialogue with works by other major 17th century poets and controversialists such as Thomas Hobbes, Andrew Marvell, John Dryden, and Lucy Hutchinson. Finally, we will explore Milton's subtle and not-so subtle influence on later writers in contexts ranging from the Enlightenment, to the Romantic period, to the American Revolution, to the Cold War.",

The course will begin by introducing students to how an economist approaches problems of market failure commonly found in environmental contexts. Next, we will explore models that characterize solutions to such environmental issues. We will then address questions regarding measurement, the design of environmental regulations, and, finally, we will apply the tools that we have developed during the semester to the problems of climate change, and the optimal management of forests, water resources, and land use. (Lecture, 3 hours). Minimum grade standard of \"C\" applies only to economics courses.

As the course name suggests, it will teach hand and machine methods for making the basic joints of stick construction in woodworking: the mortise and tenon and the dovetail, while also exploring unique joints which are derived from hand tools, or power tools techniques. It will explore variations in these basic joints which can be altered to meet the myriad unique situations of furniture making. Variations include perpendicular and angled joints with two, three, and more intersecting members. Emphasis will be placed on developing hand tool skills with the chisel, plane, and saw. Sharpening of hand tools will be demonstrated and students will be required to sharpen the tools they use. Joints and fabrication techniques will be demonstrated in class and assignments relating to them will be issued. Demonstrations may not take the entire class time in which case the students will work for the remainder of class time under the instructor?s supervision. In class work is an important component of the class, and out of class assignments are also required. Assignments will consist of practice exercises and joints in large stock of softer hardwoods to develop hand and machine skills and knowledge of layouts. Attention will be directed to grain direction, orientation of faces and edges to maximize strength, and accommodation of later actions performed on the intersecting parts (like carving and shaping). The final grade will be based on submission of all assignments, quality of workmanship, and uniqueness of design. This mini course will focus on the development of skills however there will be constant opportunity to incorporate and refine design. There will be hard labor through which you will develop blisters, calluses, muscle, dexterity, and perseverance. You will also develop knowledge of materials and techniques.",

These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations. The emphasis is on process, not product \u2014 devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development \u2014 both of which are explored here. We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included: Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more. Students learn to define and distinguish these artist's approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion. This class is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline.

This course provides an in-depth understanding of the basic principles and techniques of the art of formal writing. Rhythm, texture and composition are achieved through routine, elementary exercises using geometric forms, demanding concentration and manual discipline with the development of hand-eye coordination. The function, use, and harmonious sequencing of letterforms is taught through weekly projects. Awareness of rhythm, texture and letterform structure is achieved through routine exercises. Drills, demonstrations, discussions, individual and class critiques are on-going. Additional related topics and activities introduced in class include books: binding and design. A brief introduction to the historical development of our Western alphabet is provided through film, slides, demonstrations, with discussion of twentieth-century type designs. Students also gain exposure to letter vocabulary, paleography, monoprints, words and punctuation, classical page design, publication design-past and present, and calligraphy's role in design today. Thinking with hands and eyes, the manual placement and spacing of letters practiced in this course awakens sensitivity and judgment in the designer.",

Although invention is centrally important to rhetoric-without which it becomes a superficial and marginalized study of clarity, style, and arrangement-from the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment through the mid-twentieth century invention all but disappeared as a topic of rhetorical study under the pressure of the view that invention should be exclusively directed by deductive logic and the empirical method rather than rhetorical considerations such as audience or language. This view of invention fundamentally shaped modern thought and continues to influence the ways we think and communicate today. In this course, we'll begin by examining the repudiation of rhetorical invention in the development of modern thought before focusing on efforts to recover a rhetorical understanding of invention from the mid-twentieth century forward, surveying a variety of contemporary theories of rhetorical invention including those promoted by postmodern, posthuman, and digital rhetorics. The course is designed to explore the central importance of invention to contemporary rhetorical theory through a pairing of historical and contemporary readings.",

Reading a selection of their poems, essays, and critical theory in the context of contemporary debates, we will aim to understand the relation between print as a set of material forms, and political as well as literary ideas and discourses that contended for attention in the period's innovative print media We will also try to grasp some wider cultural processes at work in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. These included disintegration of the early modern Republic of Letters and the reconfiguration of its knowledges in the nineteenth-century cultural fields; the forming and division of new reading publics and their ways of reading print; important changes in book production, typography, printing methods (hand-press to steam press), and bookselling; and the crucially important relation between the aesthetic powers of the ?text? and the material pleasures of the \"book.\" Research papers using rare-book materials at the Hunt or Hillman library Special Collections will be especially encouraged; and the course will sometimes meet in the archive to examine \"rare and curious\" modes of print.

The following questions will motivate discussion: What is Chinese culture in the modern world? What is \"modern\" and what \"traditional\" Chinese culture? How does high culture interact with folk culture and popular culture? How have education and language policies shaped Chinese cultural identities over the last century? What does it mean to be Chinese in a diaspora context? Secondary readings, primary documents, and video material chosen for analysis will provide students with important insights into the diverse factors that have been shaping contemporary Chinese culture. This course is conducted in English with no requirement of prior knowledge of Chinese language for students who take it for 9 units. Students who take this course towards fulfillment of requirements for the Chinese major or minor must register for 12 units requiring completion of three (3) units of study in Chinese Studies.

Classroom discussions and essay writing will be the major forms of work throughout the semester. Research projects on Chinese culture and society are also a requirement so that students will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural background of the language.

Yet considerations about how we write ? coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance ? can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, \"Who is my audience\"? and \"What is my purpose\"? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising writing. Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved ?good? style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers? Course Website: http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/index.html",

In each section we will read primary sources and discuss some of the main philosophic problems associated with that area. These will include: moral problems (Ethics), problems rising from the debates about free-will, personal identity or intelligence (Metaphysics), and inquiries about the scope and limits of human knowledge (Epistemology). We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why.",

            "desc": "76-101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own. The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community. Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each student's individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

Students will study its enabling technologies, building blocks, and gain hands-on experience through projects utilizing public cloud infrastructures. Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains. The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the cloud\u00bfs motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models. Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources. Students will develop and evaluate scaling and load balancing solutions, work with cloud storage systems, and develop applications in several programming paradigms. 15619 students must complete an extra team project which entails designing and implementing a cost- and performance-sensitive web-service for querying big data.",

Thesis topics and research agendas are generated by the student, but must be determined in collaboration with an advising team, and approved by a Thesis Coordinator. The School seeks to encourage an expansive range of rigorous and provocative inquiry as a culminating experience for the B.Arch education, including work that speculates, invents, or improves on existing ideas, practices, or systems through research and design; work that challenges the boundaries of the discipline and the profession, and moves beyond mere practice or solution-based work; worj that engages with open-ended and generalizable ideas, as much as with specific situations; work that projects or imagines a better future and an improved world; work that leads to the new knowledge, ideas, understanding, or paradigms. Acceptance into Thesis is dependent on passing the 48-497 ?Thesis Prep? course or its pre-approved equivalent, and submitting a rigorous thesis proposal to the Thesis Coordinator in late August, before the begin of classes.

This method is used to isolate patterns of behavioral and communication usage and change, as revealed through the study of the world-wide web and large computerized databases such as CHILDES, TalkBank, or the British National Corpus. Tools here include text searches and data-mining. Conversation Analysis. This is a microanalytic method used to examine sequencing, repair, and orientation in closely transcribed recordings of spoken interactions, as made available through systems such as the CABank database, as well as recorded programs on YouTube and elsewhere. Coding Systems. This approach seeks to capture interactional and behavioral structures in writing, teaching, interview, and other interactions. Here, there will be a special emphasis on the coding of instructional interactions. Gesture Analysis. This microanalytic method seeks to track patterns in gestural and nonverbal communication, often in association with spoken messages. Profile Analysis. This approach studies differences across learners at various ages and ability levels and group differences involving aphasia, autism, stuttering, dementia, and other individual differences. Students will work with data already available from previous studies, and will also learn to collect their own new datasets. Although the data being examined have been generated through naturalistic processes, they can be analyzed quantitatively using time-series analyses, non-parametric statistics, error matrices, and neural network simulations. In these various analyses, we will also consider how behavioral patterns are shape",

This course examines what such icons represent in the Japanese mind, as well as how they have been used by forward-looking film directors in making their audiences aware of the emerging social changes and the altering values associated with the changes. By analyzing eight highly influential films in their respective social and historical contexts, students are expected to reconstruct the social messages conveyed by the directors through these icons.",

The course is transatlantic, incorporating the study of the cultures of Latinos in the US, Latin American and Spain. Topics vary from semester to semester, aiming to provide a thorough understanding of Latin American, Spanish and U.S. cultures in connection to issues such as race, gender, socio-economic class. Students will improve their language use (reading, speaking, writing, and listening). Prerequisites: two out of the following three courses, 82-342, 82-342 or 82-344, or permission of instructor FALL 2015: Cities and Spaces in the Spanish-speaking World: Mapping Identities, Self and Other This course focuses on the city in the Spanish-speaking world, using representations of urban landscapes in literature, film and photography as a lens to study identities and cultures. Cities are a principal organizing unit of society, the site of concentrated political and economic power, spaces that have fostered intense creativity; urban centers have functioned as sites of inclusion and exclusion, of opportunity and marginalization. The course will examine cities in Pre-Colombian times, and then consider their importance during Colonial times, as Spain's Empire was considered to be very urban. Students will explore the significance of the city in the formation of national identities from the 19th through the early 20th century, and then move to more contemporary times, which have seen an explosion of urbanization and the transformation of many cities. At present, Latin America is the most urbanized region in the world, with 80% of its population residing in cities, a figure expected to jump to 90% by 2050. While looking broadly across Spain, Latin America and the US, special consideration will be given to Barcelona, Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Santiago, New York and Los Angeles.",

We start with the premise that architecture is not merely pragmatic, technical, or functional: it can express or communicate like a language, it can represent and inspire like many of the arts, it can shape behavior and emote, it can trigger memories, emotions, or meanings. As Isozaki put it: ?Architecture is a machine for the production of meaning.? We?ll investigate many ways that architects have theorized the design process, as well as the forms, materials, and contexts of architecture, to express a myriad of ideas and sensibilities. We?ll also look at the ways that buildings can communicate and have meaning, often beyond the intent of the architect, and usually changing over time. Some of the topics to be explored include the classical orders, gothic geometry and mystical light, the theatrical space of the Baroque, architecture parlante, character, and style in the Enlightenment, tectonics as structural expression, political architecture and morality, the aesthetics of functionalism, Expressionism, key terms such as ornament, representation, linguistics, and semiotics, as well as more recent theoretical constructs such as embodiment, materiality, atmosphere, and affect. The work of the seminar will include intensive weekly readings, especially of primary sources by the architects seeking to express ideas, weekly presentations and discussions about the sources, and a term paper on an important theory of expression in architecture of your choice.",

This course is for students who want to understand the basic concepts in astronomy and what drives astronomical objects and the universe. The course emphasizes the application of a few physical principles to a variety of astronomical settings, from stars to galaxies to the structure and evolution of the universe. Introductory classical physics is required, but modern physics will be introduced as needed in the course. The course is intended for science and engineering majors as well as students in other disciplines with good technical backgrounds. Computer lab exercises will be used to gain practical experience in astronomical techniques. In addition, small telescopes are available for personal sign-out for those who would like to use them, and outdoor observing sessions will be organized as weather permits.",

In these contexts photographs often work with words to convey meaning, whether they are shown with captions, news stories, or just with titles. Photographs can work without words, too, to create purely visual narratives. In this course, students will make two series of photographs: one that is fiction and one that is non-fiction. In addition to making photographs, students will determine the context in which their photo-stories will be seen. Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen on a website. While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photo-graphic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith to the documentarians such as Walker Evans, Nicholas Nixon, and Alec Soth. We will look at photographers, too, who constructed private worlds, such as Duane Michals, Cindy Sherman, Bruce Charlesworth, and Laurie Simmons. As students explore both fiction and non-fiction through photographs, we will look at the interesting interplay between words and photographic images; how images are paced and scaled to create tempos; how photographs are sequenced to tell stories; and other formal elements involved in creating visual narratives.

From child soldiers to sex workers, from adoptees to laborers, children form part of a global circulation that has complex personal, practical, and political consequences. We will take an anthropological and a historical perspective, comparing the various ways in which children circulate, the changes over time, and the impact of scholarly writings, legal systems, and human rights policies on these movements. We will analyze the role of nation-states, international organizations, and NGO's, along with the decisions individuals make about the well being of a child.

The class will provide students with a solid foundation about the history of the art market in order to gain a perspective about the rise and power of the art market today. We will examine who are the current players and operational mechanisms. We will investigate the following: Who are the key players?, Cities?, Collectors?, Professional training? And, investigate Institutions and organizations that influence the acceptance of certain artists, the rise of certain ideologies and the contraction of others. Visits to several institutions, discussions with collectors and auction sites will also occur. An analysis of the 56th Venice Biennale as a point of reference will occur in order to demonstrate why this international show has a particular slant and how the director?s point of view influences the selection of artists and themes.

The latter part of the course will extend the study to instrumental music of the 16th century, and explore the development of chromaticism in avant-garde composers of the time. Reading about and listening to Renaissance music and composers will be included as background context for the theory work. Daily writing exercises in the first part of the course will lead to a term project producing a performable piece of music by the end of the semester. This course is designed for composers (both for writing technique and college teaching preparation), theory minors, early music lovers, choral singers and conductors, church musicians, and anyone who wants to sharpen their writing skills.

In most cases, the goal should be to design and maintain a process which is in statistical control, producing with the \"best\" nominal value, and with a minimum of variation. How to determine what is \"best\" is a topic which we will also discuss; we will explore the use of the Taguchi Loss Function to help answer this question. We will also consider issues surrounding successful adoption of quality initiatives \u00bf finding ways of improving quality but being unable to get anyone to implement them is a prototypical problem in quality programs. We will then discuss strategies and tools which can be used to try to ensure quality; it is important to not only be familiar with the tools of quality design and control, but also to understand when and how they can best be correctly applied. In this area we will study three central topics \u00bf the first two, sampling and control charts, serve as a basis for the correct application and evaluation of the third, design of experiments. These central topics will be illustrated through exercises, experiments, and cases, culminating in a final interactive capstone case for the class. We will conclude with a discussion of six-sigma, exploring its similarities and differences as compared to traditional quality programs. At the conclusion of the course you will understand the six-sigma framework, and be comfortable with its technical tools. Other topics we will consider include process capability, setting tolerances, process control, quality in service operations, evaluatory techniques such as the House of Quality, and ISO 9000 certification. The goal of the course is not to indoctrinate students into any single quality assurance framework, but rather to teach them the techniques that are common, and central, to any effective quantitative quality design and maintenance program.",

The course will have a strong component of Special Relativity, dealing with kinematics and dynamics, but not electricity and magnetism. (See 33-213 description.) It will introduce students to a conceptual theory, which is mathematically simple but (initially) non-intuitive. The course also provides a broad exposure to quantum phenomena and early quantum theory without getting overly mathematical. It leads into the more formal Quantum Physics course (33-234).",

The Capstone should include elements that span the student's CFA and DC concentrations (for BHA students), CFA and MCS concentrations (for BSA students), or CFA and SCS concentrations (for BCSA students). The project can be either a scholarly or creative endeavor, and may take one of many possible forms (e.g., a written thesis, a compilation of creative work or works, an experiment and report, a computer program or animation, etc.). The BXA Capstone sequence covers both semesters of a student's senior year. In the fall, students are enrolled in 52-401 BXA Seminar IV: Capstone Fall (9 units), which meets weekly to discuss strategies for managing research, planning the project, and larger theoretical issues related to interdisciplinary work. At the end of the fall course, students will have produced a Capstone Project proposal, an annotated bibliography, and multiple versions of their project pitch. In the spring, students enroll in 52-402 BXA Seminar: Capstone Spring (9 units), which has no required classroom time. Instead, students spend the semester doing the research and foundational work necessary for the project, as well as meeting with their faculty and BXA advisors as they create their Capstone Project and prepare to present it at the annual Meeting of the Minds Undergraduate Research Symposium held each May. Students will only be enrolled in 52-400 (9 units) when they are unable to complete a two-semester sequence and need to gain special permission by the BXA Director/Academic Advisor.",

It is intended for seniors who are eager to creatively apply their learned knowledge skills, and who are interested in invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship. The first half (part 1 (27-501), mini 1) will focus on the process of invention for devices and technologies that are enabled by materials functionality. This will start by providing historical context and addressing the questions \"What is invention?\" This will be followed by an assessment of various systematic methods by which the process of invention is practiced, with a specific focus on materials intensive devices and products. The second half of the course (part 2 (27-502) mini 2) will examine innovation theory in the context of materials intensive technologies. Specifically, the concepts of incumbency, disruption, value chain, supply chain, funding models and paths to market will be addressed. In this class, significant time will be dedicated to covering the impact of international market and technology development.",

Sources of error and methods for assessing the reliability of phylogenetic inference will be discussed. We will cover additional topics as time allows, such as phylogenetic hypothesis testing, genome scale approaches, the interface between phylogenetics and population genetics, gene tree reconciliation, horizontal gene transfer, and phylogenetic networks. Course work will include readings from textbooks and seminal articles from the primary literature, problem sets, a final exam and possibly in class exams. Students in 03-727 will also carry out a major data analysis project, intended to familiarize the student with the practical application of principles taught in class.

It is no exaggeration to say that our own structures of feeling concerning love, sex, and adventure still reflect this influence. This course will juxtapose some of the medieval tales that found the genre with their more recent counterparts, for example Chretien's Lancelot with Malory's retelling of that story in Morte D'Arthur, Tennyson's retelling of Malory, and T. H. White's Once and Future King (the basis of the musical and film Camelot). Recent novels such as Scott Spencer's Endless Love, A.S. Byatt's Possession, and Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose are also set beside their medieval antecedents.

This often relies on successful collaborations between cross-trained artists, designers and technologists as well as critical reflection on distribution, participation, interaction and audience. This course is designed to prepare engineers and scientists to work in these contexts. By the end of the course, students will be able to think critically across several media theory paradigms; formulate the intent of their creative work; articulate relationships to art/design practice and theory; and respond insightfully to creative outcomes. The goal is not just to make creative media rich outcomes but also to think critically about their production. Organized as three related 7-week modules, all students will take 'Critical Media Analysis' and can then choose to focus on 'Visual Synthesis' or 'Sound Synthesis'. Modules will introduce core concepts through foundational texts, in-class exercises, collaborative projects, and group critique. Students will ground concepts such as critical design, computational performance, embodiment, emergence, composition, participatory interfaces, and media editing through hands-on, applied exploration. Weekly lab sessions will also support the development of new skills and practical development of digitally mediated content.

The students work in the course must lead to the production of a written paper which will be read by the instructor directing the readings. Often the reading is related to a research project which the student may wish to conduct. Readings courses have also been used to give students an opportunity to receive instruction in areas which are not included elsewhere in our course listing. The course may be taken for any number of units up to 9, depending upon the amount of work to be done.",

For each type of nanoparticles, we select pedagogical examples (e.g. Au, Ag, CdSe, etc.) and introduce their synthetic methods, physical and chemical properties, self assembly, and various applications. Apart from the nanoparticle materials, other topics to be briefly covered include microscopy and spectroscopy techniques for nanoparticle characterization, and nanolithography techniques for fabricating nano-arrays. The course is primarily descriptive with a focus on understanding major concepts (such as plasmon, exciton, polaron, etc.). The lectures are power point presentation style with sufficient graphical materials to aid students to better understand the course materials. Overall, this course is intended to provide an introduction to the new frontiers of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Students will gain an understanding of the important concepts and research themes of nanoscience and nanotechnology, and develop their abilities to pursue highly disciplinary nanoscience research. The course should be of interest and accessible to advanced undergraduates and graduate students in fields of chemistry, materials science, and biology. 3 hrs. lec.",

            "desc": "Interaction is a fundamental part of social science: firms market products to consumers, people share opinions and information with their friends, workers collaborate on projects, agents form alliances and coalitions. In this course, we will use the emerging field of social networks to put structure on this diverse mass of connections. Using a mixture of theoretical, empirical, and computational methods, we will learn about the structure and function of social networks. We will look at how an individual's position in a social network reflects her role in the community. We will learn to identify tastemakers and trendsetters by looking at how information moves through our increasingly connected society. We will consider how our own position in the social network affects our behavior, opinions, and outcomes. And we will explore where social networks come from, and what affects their structure. The material in this course will be interdisciplinary, drawn from the fields of math, computer science, physics, sociology, political science, and economics. By the end of the course, you will have the tools and knowledge needed to analyze social networks on your own. The course is capped with a project where you will use your skills to answer your own questions. (Lecture, 3 hours). Minimum grade standard of \"C\" applies only to economics courses.

The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them. To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking and managing impressions. Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work. Readings come from both the research and the managerial literatures. Among the topics considered are managerial communication, persuasion and conformity, self presentation and person perception, social networks.

We will develop the theory of various complexity classes, such as P, NP, co-NP, PH, #P, PSPACE, NC, AC, L, NL, UP, RP, BPP, IP, and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy.

In these contexts photographs often work with words to convey meaning, whether they are shown with captions, news stories, or just with titles. Photographs can work without words, too, to create purely visual narratives. In this course, students will make a photo narrative and determine how it will be seen. Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen digitally on screen. While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photographic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith to the documentarians such as Walker Evans, Nicholas Nixon, and Alec Soth. We will look at photographers, too, who construct fictional worlds, such as Duane Michals, Cindy Sherman, and Gregory Crewdson. As students make their own narratives, we will look at the interplay between words and photographic images; how images are paced and scaled to create rhythm; how photographs are sequenced to tell stories; and other formal elements involved in creating visual narratives. 12-15 students.

The course, designed as a prerequisite for 76-101, emphasizes reading comprehension strategies for reading a variety of text types in English (e.g., journalism, textbook selections, popular press arguments, and academic journal articles). Throughout the semester, students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers' expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels. Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers. Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. (All sections are offered MWF). Each 76-100 course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English, but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings.",

Together we will examine the different ways the three states responded to internal and external crises and transformed into modern nationhood. We will also consider interpretations of the past that continue to impact how East Asians today perceive themselves, their countries, and international relations. Some of the topics covered will include globalization, imperialism, nationalism, gender politics, and the role of historical memory (as in Nanking, Hiroshima and the Korean War). Historical sources will include primary and secondary documents, pictures, films and memoirs.",

The course will also examine Indian economic growth since the early 1980s, and compare India's experience with that of the East Asian economies.

When written sources are available, the course will interrogate them to illuminate the changes that occurred in African societies during the early period of contact with Europeans. Lastly, by focusing on long-term processes, such as economic specialization, urbanization, and Islamization, the course will begin to put the slave trade in an African-centered perspective.",

The main focus of the course is to develop an understanding of how theories from social science, such as economics, can help us understand policy issues such as allocation, regulation, and welfare. Throughout the course we analyze outcomes produced by private markets, by examining consumer choice, the supply and demand of factors and produced goods, and general and partial equilibrium. We also analyze the efficiency and welfare properties of such outcomes, paying special attention to the role of policy in influencing market outcomes. We consider how policy can address the efficiency and welfare shortcomings of markets that may result from informational asymmetries, industrial organization, moral hazard, transactions costs, and bounded rationality. Markets are compared in this light with organizational, governmental, and other modes of resource allocation. Grading will be based mainly on 3 exams. Homework assignments and/or quizzes will comprise a smaller part of the grade.",

Tackling ongoing debates in the news today, including recent events in Charleston, we'll trace the roots of those events back to the American Civil War.

It is a set of tools with which firms identify good investments and decide how to pay for them. Paying for them ultimately involves getting money from households. Therefore, finance also describes the investment decisions of households and the resulting allocation of the economy's resources across firms and time. This course is the introductory finance course in the undergraduate business program. The main topics covered in the course are Financial Markets, Net Present Value, The Objective of the Firm, Discounted Cash Flow, Portfolio Theory and the Cost of Capital, The Efficient Markets Hypothesis, The Capital Structure of the Firm, and Business Valuation. Time permitting, the course will also provide an introduction to option markets and derivative securities. Upon completing the course a student will be able to consider a large and complex business problem, make some assumptions, structure the firms' cash flows in a spreadsheet, calculate the value of different solutions to the problem, and make a decision.

Eventually, the strategic basis for U. S. foreign policy in general was called into question. The U. S. withdrew combat troops in 1973, and Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese in 1975 as America watched from its living room. This course covers the war in Vietnam from the 1950s through the fall of Saigon in 1975 and its legacies.

Indeed, the protection of these essential rights in many ways drove and defined their successful rebellion from Britain. This impulse resulted in ten amendments to the Constitution, which we have come to know as the Bill of Rights. The very first (and arguably considered at the time as the most essential) of these was the First Amendment, which we sometimes call the \"free speech\" amendment to the Constitution. This amendment guarantees every U.S. citizen five freedoms: freedom of religion, speech, press, peaceable assembly, and the freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances. This course examines the historical and philosophical roots of this key constitutional amendment, how it has been fleshed out and defined over time through case law, and the bases of some more recent critics of this amendments and current interpretations.",

            "desc": "In 1920, perhaps for the first time, youth began to be identified as having a distinct subculture. This phenomenon occurred in part because of the development of mass media, including popular books and magazines, movies, and recordings. These media provided both objects with which adolescents identified and hence defined themselves, and representations of the activities of youth to the rest of the population. This course will focus on films which have since the twenties performed these functions. It will pay particular attention to post-W. W. II youth subcultures in the United States and Britain such as the student-radical subculture or punk subculture. We will also look at the representations that the mass media have created of youth: from the \"flaming youth\" of the twenties to the juvenile delinquents of the fifties. While both movies and records are art forms, they are also commodities. They are products of what Adorno calls the \"culture industry.\" In the 1950s, youth becomes a specific market for which a host of special products are created. These include genres of both movies and records, but also clothes, food, toothpaste. etc. While earlier products of large film studios and record companies aimed at the widest possible audience and tended to openly reflect mainstream values, the movies and records designed for teenagers tried explicitly to appeal to the values of a presumed youth subculture. Perhaps as a result\u2014or perhaps for other reasons\u2014some of these materials appear to be subversive of the dominant culture. A major question which this course will try to answer is whether youth culture has in fact been generally, or even occasionally, subversive, or whether it has served mainly to reinforce the dominant ideology.

A variety of sections are offered in order to give students the opportunity to choose between different themes and approaches. All sections are comparable in their composition of lectures and recitations, required amounts of reading, and emphasis on written assignments as the central medium of assessment. The sections all aim to help students: (1) master knowledge through interaction with the instructors, reading material, and other students, (2) think critically about the context and purpose of any given information, (3) craft effective verbal and written arguments by combining evidence, logic, and creativity, and (4) appreciate the relevance of the past in the present and future.

Expanded Theater will reanimate classical modes of performance with media, networks, robotics, locative applications, and mobile systems. Considering theater as an ancient technology of mass participation and social cohesion, this fusion studio explores how emerging technologies can expand upon the basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways. Collaboration and integration of design, media and storytelling is critical to this approach. Experimentation with new forms can reanimate the basic values of theater; the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience. Expanded Theater is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional theatrical production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline. The curriculum combines resources from Carnegie Mellon's Schools of Art and Drama, Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe), the Emerging Media Masters (EM2), Computer Science, the Robotics Institute, and their collaborators across the university in a new configuration. Expanded Theater will explore domains ranging from site specific and networked-based performance and interventionist practices, to pervasive social media technologies and their influence on interpersonal communication. The goal is to investigate contemporary languages that allow authors, actors and technologists to collaborate in ways that push beyond our present understanding of theatrical production and reception.

Students can expect to learn how to program with the embedded architecture that is ubiquitous in cell-phones, portable gaming devices, robots, PDAs, etc. Students will then go on to learn and apply real-time principles that are used to drive critical embedded systems like automobiles, avionics, medical equipment, the Mars rover, etc. Topics covered include embedded architectures (building up to modern 16/32/64-bit embedded processors); interaction with devices (buses, memory architectures, memory management, device drivers); concurrency (software and hardware interrupts, timers); real-time principles (multi-tasking, scheduling, synchronization); implementation trade-offs, profiling and code optimization (for performance and memory); embedded software (exception handling, loading, mode-switching, programming embedded systems). Through a series of laboratory exercises with state-of-the-art embedded processors and industry-strength development tools, students will acquire skills in the design/implementation/debugging of core embedded real-time functionality.

As we analyze literature, visual arts, social debates, and current events, we will investigate how contacts with various forms of alterity have informed conceptions of identity and difference in 20th century France. The construction of Frenchness will be analyzed through the ways in which the society reacts to difference. To achieve these goals, the seminar will focus on five key moments in French history: the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, the Interwar period, the Second World War and the Jewish Holocaust, the tourism boom of the 1990s, and the current debates on immigration and integration. Readings will include Pierre Loti's Aziyad\u00e9, Marguerite Duras' Un Barrage contre le Pacifique, Annette Muller's La Petite Fille du Vel d'Hiv', and Herg\u00e9's Tintin en Am\u00e9rique. The course will also examine the filmic representations of alterity in Abdellatif Kechiche's V\u00e9nus Noire and Rose Bosche\u00bfs La Rafle.

We discover these through four analytical approaches: structural, psychological, feminist and socio-political. Attention is paid to the ways in which fairy tales hold sway in literature and the fine arts from centuries past right through to the present day. Course requirements include primary and secondary readings, oral presentations, written essays, tests and participation in class discussions. No prerequisites; 9 units.

Signals are the raw materials used in many forms of electronic art and design - electronic music, interactive art, video art, kinetic sculpture, and more. In these fields, signals are used to represent information about sound, images, sensors, and movement. By transforming and manipulating these types of signals, we are able to create powerful new tools for digital art, multimedia applications, music, responsive environments, video and sound installation, smart products, and beyond. In this course we will study Signal Processing from a practical point-of-view, developing tools that can be easily integrated into art-making using the graphical programming environment Max (a.k.a. Max/MSP/Jitter). We will present a survey of Signal Processing techniques used in the sonic and visual arts, and will discuss the mathematical theories underlying these techniques. Students will be encouraged to combine, modify, and extend working examples of software to create original digital artworks. Please note that there will be usage/materials fees associated with this course.",

We will explore design through its orders of activity: first in communication and second the creation of physical objects. But design has a far greater reach into the intangible and more complex areas of human activity: interaction, systems, environments, and culture. These are the topics of inquiry for design and, unlike what the patchwork of professions would have you believe, are not fixed by boundaries. Design is enormously broad and something everybody participates in as we create the artificial world in which we live. Those who call themselves designers have greater power in shaping this world and for that reason we will end the course with a discussion of ethics. Non-Design majors are welcome.",

The project begins with an introduction to user-centered methods for understanding the audience (users), where you will learn and practice foundational user-centered design methods through readings and a series of hands on exercises, including interviews, and observation of actual users. You will also learn theories and methods for developing effective information architecture, including organizational schemes, navigational design, labeling, form design, and visual design. Working in groups with other students, you will, over the course of the semester, develop a prototype of a small website, which will be evaluated through user testing at the end of the semester.

            "desc": "In the 400-year arc of opera history, the last 125 years have seen the genre's apogee, perigee, and current renaissance. Between the Wagnermania of the late nineteenth century and today's vogue for both opera and \"popera,\" new opera production slowed greatly in the third quarter of the last century as composers rejected its traditions and audiences turned increasingly to rock and pop. In this course, we will survey this trajectory by viewing and analyzing eight repertory staples: Wagner Parsifal Debussy Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande Puccini Turandot Berg Wozzeck Gershwin Porgy and Bess Britten Peter Grimes Messiaen Saint Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Reich Three Tales We will also become acquainted with other works related to these staples, from Strauss to Saariaho and Tan Dun, and ask numerous questions. What can these operas' characters and techniques tell us about late modern subjectivity? What happened to the great national traditions? In what musical styles has opera flourished and languished? How have audiences changed? How has the notion of opera itself changed, from the nature of its heroes and heroines to its performance forces and media? The goals of this course are to 1) promote intimate knowledge of the eight core operas; 2) encourage familiarity with numerous related opera plots, opera composers, and twentieth- and twenty-first-century musical styles; 3) broaden literary and musical analytical tools to include historical, aesthetic, and (multi)cultural perspectives on opera; and 4) improve oral and written communication skills about opera. Requirements: Attendance at opera screenings, readings, quizzes, small written assignments, and a 17 to 20-page research paper on an opera of your choice written since 1850.

(2) How do leaders use language and for what purposes? (3) What rhetorical strategies can be most useful to leaders to achieve their goals? (4) What is the role of creativity in leadership, and especially in the leader's use of language? We will mine the literature on leadership for theoretical insights on rhetoric.

This method is used to isolate patterns of behavioral and communication usage and change, as revealed through the study of the world-wide web and large computerized databases such as CHILDES, TalkBank, or the British National Corpus. Tools here include text searches and data-mining. Conversation Analysis. This is a microanalytic method used to examine sequencing, repair, and orientation in closely transcribed recordings of spoken interactions, as made available through systems such as the CABank database, as well as recorded programs on YouTube and elsewhere. Coding Systems. This approach seeks to capture interactional and behavioral structures in writing, teaching, interview, and other interactions. Here, there will be a special emphasis on the coding of instructional interactions. Gesture Analysis. This microanalytic method seeks to track patterns in gestural and nonverbal communication, often in association with spoken messages. Profile Analysis. This approach studies differences across learners at various ages and ability levels and group differences involving aphasia, autism, stuttering, dementia, and other individual differences. Students will work with data already available from previous studies, and will also learn to collect their own new datasets. Although the data being examined have been generated through naturalistic processes, they can be analyzed quantitatively using time-series analyses, non-parametric statistics, error matrices, and neural network simulations. In these various analyses, we will also consider how behavioral patterns are shape",

Discourse analysts set out to answer a variety of questions about language, about writers and speakers, and about sociocultural processes that surround and give rise to discourse, but all approach their tasks by paying close and systematic attention to particular texts and their contexts. We are all familiar with the informal discourse analysis involved in paraphrasing the meanings of written texts and conversations, a skill we learn in writing and literature classes and in daily life. Here we ask and answer other questions about why people use language as they do, learning to move from a stretch of speech or writing or signing outward to the linguistic, cognitive, historical, social, psychological, and rhetorical reasons for its form and its function. As we look at resources for text-building we read analyses by others and practice analyses of our own, using as data texts suggested by the class as well the instructor. In the process, we discuss methodological issues involved in collecting texts and systematically describing their contexts (ethnographic participant-observation and other forms of naturalistic inquiry; transcription and \"entextualization;\" legal and ethical issues connected with collecting and using other people's voices) as well as methodological issues that arise in the process of interpreting texts (analytical heuristics; reflexivity; standards of evidence).

Other flat structures, and three dimensional containers are examples of general forms that will be categorized as binding work. Students who wish to enroll in this course must have already taken Beginning Book Arts, and must also speak to the instructor directly about project ideas. Emphasis for binding is working independently with a greater level of hand craft and a sensitivity to materials. Emphasis for letterpress printing is to learn in depth, and master, the general mechanical process for doing press work. Emphasis for hand typesetting is on gaining an understanding of the system of cast metal type, and to develop a sensitivity to typographic principles. Instruction will be given on an individual basis through consultation at strategic times throughout the semester. Project evaluation will be based on the success of the project work compared to each student's written project proposal at the start of the semester. The Advanced Workshop in Book Arts can be repeated. For more complex project work this class can be continued for the following semester.",

However, the perception of the threats that ISIS poses to Western societies differs from the perceptions post-9/11, as do the policies the US and European governments have chosen. The frameworks of US and European policies towards \"islamist terrorism\" have been shaped primarily by the way governments and citizens experience, interpret, and assess the long \"global war on terror.\" In this course, we will review the origins of the \"global war on terror\" that started in the aftermath of 9/11, unfolded in Afghanistan and Iraq, played out in a secretive war \"on the dark side,\" and resulted in today's global surveillance effort by the US.

A building investment decision support tool ? BIDS? - continues to be developed by the Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics at Carnegie Mellon University, with the support of the Advanced Building Systems Integration Consortium. This cost-benefit decision support tool presents the substantial cost-benefits of a range of advanced and innovative building systems designed to deliver ? privacy and interaction, air quality, ergonomics, lighting control, thermal control, network flexibility, and access to the natural environment - from field case studies, laboratory studies, simulation studies, and other research efforts. This course will explore the relationship of quality buildings, building systems, and land-use to productivity, health, well-being and the environment. The course will engage students in the literature that relates building design decisions to ten cost/performance impacts: energy, facilities management, organizational change, technological change, attraction/retention (quality of life) of employees, individual productivity, organizational productivity, salvage/ waste, tax/ insurance/ litigation, and health.",

Some of the relevant research questions include: Why do visual variations exist across different contexts? (e.g., Popular science looks different from Discover.) Why and how do visual styles change over time? (e.g., Magazines from the 1950s don't look like present day magazines.) Do visual elements have persuasive power? If so, what roles do they play in shaping an argument? How do people learn to communicate using visual-verbal artifacts? In this seminar, we will address these and other questions through readings and discussions on various threads of studies around the analysis of communicative artifacts that integrate visual and verbal expressions. We will review key research publications concerning visual-verbal communication from relevant disciplines, including professional & technical communication, rhetoric, argumentation, and literacy. Particular attention will be paid to descriptive methods (e.g., social-semiotic analysis, visual argument, and rhetorical structure theory) and the types of questions these methods can help us answer. Throughout the semester, students will be encouraged to explore the visual-verbal communication artifacts found around them and use those to connect class discussions to the practice of design. Required assignments include a brief bi-weekly response to the readings, several short analysis papers, and a longer term paper with a topic chosen by students based on their professional or research interests.

What factors led to the establishment of modern R&D? Why did industrial R&D laboratories appear in the US and other industrialized nations? How did their creation change the character of science, technology, and business? How did the institutionalization of R&D affect the work of individual inventors, engineers, and scientists? Does big business now dominate R&D in the United States, or does \"the little guy\" (including university-based \"start ups\") still play an important role in technological innovation? What about the interaction of universities and industrial R&D programs? How has industrial R&D been \"managed\"? How has federal science and technology policy affected industrial RD&? With the globalization of business, is industrial R&D also becoming global, and if so, how does industrial R&D work on a global scale? Why did the last decade of the 20th century see the decline or disappearance of numerous prestigious industrial research organizations? What is the future of industrial R&D in the 21st century?

We will study modern techniques for computers to represent task-relevant information and make intelligent (i.e. satisficing or optimal) decisions towards the achievement of goals. The search and problem solving methods are applicable throughout a large range of industrial, civil, medical, financial, robotic, and information systems. We will investigate questions about AI systems such as: how to represent knowledge, how to effectively generate appropriate sequences of actions and how to search among alternatives to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. We will also explore how to deal with uncertainty in the world, how to learn from experience, and how to learn decision rules from data. We expect that by the end of the course students will have a thorough understanding of the algorithmic foundations of AI, how probability and AI are closely interrelated, and how automated agents learn. We also expect students to acquire a strong appreciation of the big-picture aspects of developing fully autonomous intelligent agents. Other lectures will introduce additional aspects of AI, including natural language processing, web-based search engines, industrial applications, autonomous robotics, and economic/game-theoretic decision making.",

You?ll never drink from a glass again without appreciating what went into making it! This class is appropriate for students with limited or no hot shop experience. You may also wish to take this class a second time in order to continue to develop and refine basic skills before moving on to Hot II. The class fee includes 1 hour of open studio time per student (2 hours with a partner), so that students can become familiar with the studio and learn the simple process of studio rental outside of class hours. Each time you take it, you will gain confidence and skill as your passion for glass grows. Registration for Pittsburgh Glass Center classes can only be done on or after your scheduled registration day. Spaces are limited. Registration is done on a first come, first served basis.

We will then move into case studies and theoretical works exploring the intersections of language use, individual and group identities, and the exercise of power, in its many forms. In particular, we will focus on the relationship between language and culture by asking, in what ways does language influence and constitute social change? How is social change reflected by changes in the way we use language?

This is followed by an overview of DNA replication, transcription, and protein synthesis, with an emphasis on the inhibitory action of antibiotics on prokaryotic processes. The fundamental properties of carbohydrates, lipids, and membranes are discussed at a level to develop an understanding of penicillin and the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. Signaling processes in eukaryotic cells is discussed with reference to cancer treatment and pain management.

The class will also briefly cover few selected topics such as collision detection and physically-based animation that are good to know even if one is developing games using a game engine. The second goal of the class is to get students familiar with programming games on various platforms using state-of-the-art game engines. To this end, the course will have a heavy programming focus. It will have a number of projects requiring students to apply the learned material to develop games using Unity 3D game engine. The students will develop games that run on a standalone PC, games that run on an Android platform and games that work in a multi-user mode. In addition to learning the material and learning how to use game engines, the projects will provide students with portfolios of games they have developed.

Existing fuel cell applications range from the small scale, such as portable cell phone chargers, to the large scale, such as MW-scale power plants. Depending on the application, fuel cell systems offer unique advantages and disadvantages compared with competing technologies. For vehicle applications, they offer efficiency and environmental advantages compared with traditional combustion engines. In the first half of the course, the focus is on understanding the thermodynamics and electrochemistry of the various types of fuel cells, such as calculating the open circuit voltage and the sources of voltage loss due to irreversible processes for the main fuel cells types: PEM/SOFC/MCFC. The design and operation of several real fuel cells are then compared against this theoretical background. The second half of the course focuses on the balance-of-plant requirements of fuel cell systems, such as heat exchangers, pumps, fuel processors, compressors, as well as focusing on capital cost estimating. Applying the material learned from the first and second halves of the class into a final project, students will complete an energy & economic analysis of a fuel cell system of their choice.

Work is done in two-person teams, and \"team programming\" skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized. The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security. Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language. The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.

Even in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with international trade and slavery supporting the manor house and plantations abroad providing the cotton for British looms, the \"England\" of English literature spanned the globe. By the first half of the twentieth century, this empire had begun to collapse in upon itself, a process witnessed by writers inside Britain and its colonies. This course will investigate British literature within the international context of global imperialism. A section on gothic stories takes us into the realm of popular culture with H. Rider Haggard?s She. We trace the torturous path into Self and Other in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, consider the portrayal of the Creole in Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea, and outline the links between colonial empire and international war rendered in Virginia Woolf?s Mrs. Dalloway. These literary works will be read alongside some of the most important works of postcolonial theory, including articles by Edward Said, Chinua Achebe, Anne McClintock, and Gillian Beer.

In addition to an ongoing review of basic grammar, a greater variety of expressions and complicated sentence structures will be taught so that students can carry on more sophisticated daily conversations on various topics related to every day life. While equal emphasis will still be on both Pinyin and characters, students will be encouraged to use more and more Chinese characters with the help of Pinyin for communication. In-class and extracurricular activities related to the broad spectrum of Chinese culture will be organized to facilitate language learning using knowledge of the cultural background of the language. Regular homework, quizzes, tests, presentations, essays, and class participation are mandatory (four in-class hours per week). A student with prior experience in Chinese must take the placement exam.

There also exists an entire pantheon of information that people typically learn \"on the job.\" Activities and information presented in this course are designed to try to expose students to as much of this on the job type development as possible with the goal of leapfrogging them past the bottom rung of the workplace ladder.

It might be said that no other class of artist dominates Los Angeles as much as show runners do. They move from one of their creations to another, often delivering material quite different in tone from one show to the next, but, if one digs deep, clearly originating from the same voice. This class will examine the work of a handful of show runners, spanning broadcast TV from the 80's (Steven Bochco & David Milch) to modern day (Ryan Murphy, Bryan Fuller, Bruno Heller, Shonda Rhimes, Barbara Hall). By contrasting their own work examples to each other, and then their work to other show runners, we'll come to a deeper understanding of the television art form.

Its role is to overcome the limitations of the traditional camera by using computational techniques to produce a richer, more vivid, perhaps more perceptually meaningful representation of our visual world. The aim of this advanced undergraduate course is to study ways in which samples from the real world (images and video) can be used to generate compelling computer graphics imagery. We will learn how to acquire, represent, and render scenes from digitized photographs. Several popular image-based algorithms will be presented, with an emphasis on using these techniques to build practical systems. This hands-on emphasis will be reflected in the programming assignments, in which students will have the opportunity to acquire their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes and develop the image analysis and synthesis tools needed to render and view the scenes on the computer.

The coverage of material will include a review of historical roots and classic approaches to the scientific study of relationships, as well as exciting new research and theory on particular subtopics. The majority of class time is spent discussing and evaluating recent research. Special emphasis also is given to learning and critically evaluating the methodological tools that are used to study close relationships. The goal is for students to leave this course with a broad overview of the field and an in-depth understanding of particular subtopics. This is an advanced seminar in which students will be expected to read original research articles and chapters on assigned topics and come to class prepared to discuss the material. Readings will consist of theoretical and empirical articles from psychology journals and related sources. Additional course requirements will involve short, weekly writing assignments, student presentations of research articles, and a written research proposal.

Linguistics is the name given to the science of language, whose task it is to give such a description. The discipline of linguistics has developed novel tools for describing and analyzing language over the last two hundred years and in this course we learn what these tools are and practice applying them. Sub-areas of linguistics which we study include phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the study of sound systems), morphology (the study of parts of words), and syntax (the study of combinations of words). Beyond this, we look at changes in language over time, and we consider the puzzle of linguistic meaning. The methods of linguistics are useful in the study of particular languages and in the study of language generally, so this course is useful for students of foreign languages as well as those interested in going on to study language acquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and computer modeling of language.",

To this end, we provide a formal treatment of pricing concepts in the framework of game theory. Finally, we also discuss non-pricing tools that firms can use in order to capture customer value. Specifically, we cover cases wherein firms generate a profit while keeping their services free, a phenomena that is widely observed among Internet firms. This course has no formal prerequisite, but a willingness to study formal (i.e., mathematical) models is assumed. Any previous exposure to microeconomics analysis and game theory will be helpful.",

The main focus will be on the narrative fiction film, but we will also discuss documentaries, avant-garde work and animation. At the same time, we will be attentive to the ways in which our conceptual understanding of film has impacted the development of successive waves of visual media. The central organizing principle is historical, but there are a number of recurring thematic concerns. These include an examination of the basic principles and terminology of filmmaking, the development of film technology, the definition of film as both art and business, the history of film as an object of critical and cultural study, and the importance of film as the precursor of newer formats. The course has four key goals. First, to provide students with a solid grounding in the key issues and concepts of film studies. Second, to expand their ability to knowledgeably critique individual cinematic works and the relationship of those works to the larger culture. Third to provide students with experience in expressing those critiques in verbal, written and visual forms. Lastly, to provide them with an understanding of the central role of film history and film studies in the development of newer media.",

Through class discussions and assignments, it enables them to not only recognize but also make connections between what they find in, for example, anime they watch and what they learn from readings about various aspects of Japanese culture. By so doing, it helps them look at Japanese popular culture from the Japanese point of view as well as their own. Through an individual project, it also equips them with the necessary skills for cultural and cross-cultural analyses of Japanese products (e.g., humanoid robots) and practices (e.g., virtual realties as practiced by computer games) that often appear in popular culture. Furthermore it provides them with opportunities to critically examine various factors contributing to the globalization of Japanese popular culture and its impact on the world-view of the Japanese people.

The course assumes no background courses in business and is appropriate for those who are interested in bringing innovations to market either through new companies or existing companies. The course provides an overview of entrepreneurship and innovation, develops an entrepreneurial frame of mind, and provides a framework for learning the rudiments of how to generate ideas. Students come up with or are presented with potential ideas and learn how to develop these ideas into opportunities, and to explore their potential for becoming viable businesses. They learn how to do market research, to develop go-to-market strategies, value propositions and to differentiate their products or services from potential competitors. The focus is on understanding and developing strategies for approaching the key elements of the entrepreneurial process...opportunity, resources and team. The course consists of a balance of lectures, case studies and encounters with entrepreneurs, investors and business professionals. The students are exposed to financial and intellectual property issues, and encounter a real world perspective on entrepreneurship, innovation and leadership. The output of the course is a mini-business plan or venture opportunity screening document that can be developed into a business plan in a subsequent course entitled New Venture Creation or through independent study.",

The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking and managing impressions. Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work.

Students will move beyond the textbooks to explore primary source documents, maps, photographs, biographies and historical testimony. For five weeks in the middle of the semester, students will immerse themselves in an extended role-playing exercise, \"The Struggle for Palestine, 1936,\" an elaborate simulation game linked to Barnard College's \"Reacting to the Past\" program. Students portraying British examiners, specific Arab and Zionist characters and various journalists will recreate the activities of the 1936 Royal Commission which came to Palestine to investigate the causes of an Arab rebellion and Arab-Jewish strife. This historical reenactment experience constitutes an exciting pedagogical opportunity for delving deeper into the topic material than regular coursework allows. All the role-playing will take place during regular class time, but students should be aware that they will need to devote outside time for preparation and research. Outstanding attendance is also a requirement. Regular classroom activity resumes at the end of the five weeks. The goal of the course is for students to develop a nuanced understanding of the varying goals and priorities of all the actors in Mandate Palestine.

The work in which they are involved often does not materialize in their lifetimes; in fact, the duration of the projects are so long twenty, thirty, fifty and hundred year timeframes, it is more than likely that he or she will pass on before the project reaches fruition. The trouble with predicting the future is that it is so uncertain, so undecided, so unknowable. A brief look backwards reveals that we are not the first generation to consider the future. History is replete with predictions, some of which were actualized, the vast majority of which were not. Today's forecasts for tomorrow vary wildly. A handful of optimists view the future through rose colored glasses, whereby humanity is delivered to salvation via technological wonders and the widespread adoption of common social values. A larger group predicts the end of the world as we now know it, but even they cannot agree on the cause of our demise, with those arguing that climate change will kill us clashing with those convinced that we will be destroyed when robots achieve technological singularity. Shy of total extinction, however, any vision of the future requires designers, and will likely occur in urban (or formerly urban) locations. As of this decade, for the first time in history, more than half of the world's population, almost three and a half billion people, live in towns and cities.

The course includes discussion of basic atmospheric science and meteorology to support understanding air pollution behavior. Concepts in this area include vertical structure of the atmosphere, atmospheric general circulation, atmospheric stability, and boundary layer turbulence. The course also discusses briefly the negative impacts of air pollution on society and the regulatory framework for controlling pollution in the United States. The principles taught are applicable to a wide variety of air pollutants but special focus is given to tropospheric ozone and particulate matter. The course is intended for graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates. It assumes a knowledge of mass balances, fluid mechanics, chemistry, and statistics typical of an undergraduate engineer but is open to students from other scientific disciplines. 12 units Course Website: http://www.cmu.edu/me/",

The semester will be broken in to 3 parts:Intro/Exploration and a long term project. In Intro/Exploration, students will have many hands on opportunities to start to build a common language to describe spacial investigations as well as creating them. This will consist of short projects, with each design investigation progressively building upon the previous exploration; these early projects will consist of both individual and group work. They will focus on Making. The second half of the semester will consist of one long term project to be created individually, incorporating students? personal theories of architecture based on an overarching question. Studio work will be supported by group discussion based upon critical review of student work, readings, slide presentations, videos and films. There will also be a few field trips. Students are encouraged to explore their own areas of interest with respect to their work in class. Self-motivation, class attendance and an open mind is mandatory, however, no prior architectural, engineering or artistic experience is required.

How do gender and sexuality define everyday performance? How does aesthetic performance - art, theater, film, digital media, poetry - intervene in the ways in which gender and sexuality are performed? Readings in theory at the intersection between gender studies and performance studies will help us explore these questions. We will read Judith Butler's work on gender as performative, Joseph Roach's work on the history of celebrity, Marvin Carlson's work on theater, and Rebecca Schneider's work on performing the past through historical enactment. We will also read and view a wide variety of cultural and artistic practices, beginning with the British 17th century up to the recent work of feminist and queer performance artists. Your written and spoken contributions to the class will, besides regular postings on the course materials and participation in class discussions, entail the investigation of an everyday, cultural, or aesthetic performance of your choosing.

Concepts in this area include vertical structure of the atmosphere, atmospheric general circulation, atmospheric stability, and boundary layer turbulence. The course also discusses briefly the negative impacts of air pollution on society and the regulatory framework for controlling pollution in the United States. The principles taught are applicable to a wide variety of air pollutants but special focus is given to tropospheric ozone and particulate matter. The course is intended for graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates.

This course will use ethnographic writings (descriptive accounts of particular cultures), as well as ethnographic films, to investigate the ways in which diverse societies structure family life, resolve conflict, construct gender relations, organize subsistence, etc. We will assess the advantages and pitfalls of comparing cross-cultural data, analyze the workings of power within and between societies, and consider the politics of cultural representations. We will also discuss the anthropologist's relationship to the people s/he studies, and the responsibilities inherent in that relationship.

Example, Fall 2011: Poe defined the short story as something that could be read at one sitting. While simple enough, the definition suggests a concern with concentrated form and unified artistic effect. in a sense, the short story has been around as long as people have been telling each other tales, to be sure, but as a literary form it came into its own in modern times, during the 19th century and it continues to be produced in considerable numbers. For many readers one of the great features is the one Poe pointed to: it is short. People who have never finished a novel by Henry James must be legion. So we can experience something with genuine literary merit, in an accessible form. Concentration, of course, can bring issues of comprehension and often short stories can seem puzzling or incomplete to the average reader. This class will attempt to develop our abilities to read with care and attention\u2014and feeling\u2014in order to make us better readers of any artistic text. The challenges of the short form turn out to be excellent opportunities for learning a lot, in a little space. We'll make use of several inexpensive anthologies, and look at one or two central writers (Hemingway, for example) in more depth. The class will require the writing of a few short papers, engaging in online discussions on Blackboard, and three in class tests.",

Covering topics such as pornography, feminism, bros, queer theory, and transgender rights, this course will introduce you how power and inequality have historically and structurally impacted categories of gender in American society. We will read novels, scholarly texts, and even blogs in an effort to understand how gender intersects with other forms of identity (such as race, class, sexuality, ability, and nationality). Through a combination of class discussions, written essays, and short presentations, we will ultimately understand gender as a social construct that nonetheless is meaningful, personal, and significant for all members of society.",

The proliferation of digital music distribution has revolutionized how music is experienced in the 21st century. Technologies for music listening, music sharing, and music discovery are in a state of rapid and limitless evolution. There is no longer a single model for a rewarding life in the world of music ? we must learn to adapt to the constantly evolving landscape of the 21st century. We must hack the music world! While examining new approaches to distribution and publication, we will also explore the question of how electronic media is redefining our understanding of music-making itself. Does a new album necessarily need to be a fixed set of sound recordings? What if it was a mobile app that reacts to the listener?s environment? What if our new album used mutating algorithms to generate new musical experiences every time the listener hits play? Throughout the semester we will form teams combining musicians, software programmers, artists, and entrepreneurs. Our teams will work together to produce new music, to design new music distribution methodologies, and to perform social media experiments that enhance the visibility of our work. Students participating in the course should have proficiency in one or more of the following areas: Social Media Optimization, Music Recording or Video Production, Leveraging Web Application API?s, Mobile Application Design & Implementation.

Students work directly with their partner throughout the semester to establish goals and requirements, evaluate their design as it progresses, and produce a final report, presentation, and, if appropriate, a prototype. Design reviews, held twice during the semester, give students a chance to present their preliminary designs and receive feedback and advice. In completing their designs, teams must consider not only the functionality of their designs, but also the look, feel, appearance, and societal impact. Skills built in this course will include: developing the product statement, establishing goals and constraints for the product, project management, and generating and evaluating design alternatives. As some projects may span multiple semesters with new groups of students, careful documentation of project work is emphasized. Students may take this course for either one or two semesters.",

Students are also encouraged to communicate in longer sentences and write short paragraphs and essays in Chinese. Regular homework, quizzes, tests, and participation in class are mandatory (four in-class hours per week). Students will continue to learn the phonetic transcriptions of Chinese (Pinyin) for speaking and listening as well as Chinese characters for reading and writing. The elementary level is designed to help students learn to reflect and draw upon strategies used by good language learners in their second language study. A student with prior experience in Chinese must take the placement exam. Instructions for taking the placement exam are available in Baker Hall 160. Prerequisite: 82-131 or 82-133 or placement",

We explore this Golden Age of Piracy, investigating how these privateers created their own counter-culture. Equally important were the \"ladies of the night\" who eagerly anticipated the ships' return to port. Our course discusses how some of these women were able to amass fortunes off the pirates' plunder, and even became pirates themselves. We will examine various texts depicting sailors, pirates and their wenches, including paintings, cartoons, novels, songs about sailing, and plays. In doing so, students will be able to see how people dealt with various problems associated with privateers: sailors kidnapping loved ones, drunkenly tearing up the ports and spreading venereal disease, and enacting revenge against the Royal Navy's barbarity.",

In particular, students will observe how countercultural identities (national, social, sexual, racial, economic) are formed, articulated and negotiated through playing, listening and dancing to popular music. The course will focus on the cultural production of the 1960s-1980s Latin America, and on musical genres such as rock, and Afro-Caribbean rhythms (salsa, son, bolero, guaracha, etc.), though an effort will be made to go beyond this focus and establish connections with alternate and/or more recent examples in order to enrich our historical understanding of the topic. Assigned texts for this course will include readings by Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Rosario Ferr\u00e9, Jose Agust\u00edn, Luis Rafael S\u00e1nchez, Andr\u00e9s Caicedo, and Ana Lydia Vega; films such as La noche de los l\u00e1pices, and documentaries like Cocolos y rockeros and Buena Vista Social Club.

We will learn how sensory coding interacts with top-down processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development.

In order to understand the context of healing in cross-cultural perspective, we will problematize the boundaries between medicine and other arenas of social life: religion, politics, law, economics, etc. We will investigate issues of medical efficacy (what \"works\"?) by asking who or what is being healed in different kinds of medical practices, and we will consider the ways in which power and social control are exerted through medical discourses of various sorts. Finally, we will examine the history of medical anthropology from its \"clinical\" origins in international development, through anthropological critiques of clinical perspectives, to attempts to fuse clinical and critical approaches. Throughout the course, Western medical practice will be analyzed as one of many forms of ethnomedicine and ethnopsychology.",
