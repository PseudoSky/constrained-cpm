Each project is sponsored by an industry, government or non-profit partner, and is of real commercial interest to that partner. Students work directly with their partner throughout the semester to establish goals and requirements, evaluate their design as it progresses, and produce a final report, presentation, and, if appropriate, a prototype. Design reviews, held twice during the semester, give students a chance to present their preliminary designs and receive feedback and advice. In completing their designs, teams must consider not only the functionality of their designs, but also the look, feel, appearance, and societal impact. Skills built in this course will include: developing the product statement, establishing goals and constraints for the product, project management, and generating and evaluating design alternatives. As some projects may span multiple semesters with new groups of students, careful documentation of project work is emphasized. Students may take this course for either one or two semesters."

To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around? Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go? Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons? Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe? As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used. This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us. We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates. Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking. The course will enhance students' ability to think clearly about contentious technology choices, formulate smart positions, and support their views with winning arguments."

Then we will see how problems which seem to have no intuitive solution look simple after being put in the right mathematical form, but also consider the limitations this type of approach. We will treat such issues as they arise both in applied fields (policy decision-making, physics, computer science) and as more recreational, speculative and abstract (Conway's game of life, the works of Escher, music).

These broader traditions may be examined along with additional examples from small, isolated or ancient cultures, such as the Hopi or the Aborigines of Australia. Across cultures, we will explore the aesthetics of cardinal cultural \"objects\" (architecture, painting, sculpture, performance/ritual, dance, film, and other media) through readings and discussions. Each student's individual definition of the nature of the arts will be constantly measured with and against the ideas of other cultures, all developing an interactive and integrative dialogue. Other issues include: the study and understandings of the roots of the iconoclastic traditions and their constant struggle and interaction between the meanings of the icon and the image; the notion of cultural \"otherness\"; and how aesthetic problems manifest themselves in our world in immediate and violent ways; and the evolution of the drive for the preservation of cultural memory in light of recent destructive events in Afghanistan and Iraq."

This course is survey of current approaches to and theories about the perception and cognition of music. Topics covered include psychoacoustics; the cognitive neuroscience of music; relationships between music and language; the nature of musical knowledge; and debates about aesthetics, evolutionary psychology, and musical universals. At the end of this course a student should be able to identify key theories and hypotheses in music cognition as they relate to memory, emotion, physiology, neurology, acoustics, language, and evolution. They will be able to comparatively evaluate hypotheses and place them in an intellectual context. These objectives will be achieved though critical reading, discussions, and written exercises. There are no prerequisites for this course. It will be helpful for you to know some basic elements of music theory (such as the names for chords, Roman numerals, and so on), but some extra help will be available to cover these topics. Some notational basics will be covered in the first lecture."

The course covers technical topics in four areas: (1) concepts of design for complex systems, (2) object oriented programming, (3) static and dynamic analysis for programs, and (4) concurrent and distributed software. Student assignments involve engagement with complex software such as distributed massively multi-player game systems and frameworks for graphical user interaction."

The first half of the course will be theoretical, covering nucleation, growth, instability, solidification microstructure: cells, dendrites, eutectic and peritectic structures, solute redistribution, inclusion formation and separation, defects and heat transfer problems. The second part of the course will be process oriented and will include conventional and near net shape casting, investment casting, rapid solidification and spray casting where the emphasis will be on process design to avoid defects."

The introduction of the study abroad process and travel options will encourage students to consider a study away experience into their academic curriculum. Students will explore their additional academic interests by identifying their psychological preferences through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and matching these preferences with academic minors/additional majors at CMU. The presentation of the Intern Development Program (IDP) will engage students in considering future plans for earning IDP hours and understanding the process of securing an architectural internship. Students will be introduced to the process of developing an independent research project. Additional topical areas to be covered in the seminar will include an evaluation of the previous semester, scholarship/academic funding opportunities, graduate studies, and schedule planning for upcoming semesters."

We move up in scale from the individual and group to the community to consider our designers' biases in how we analyze the human needs, how we judge the quality of space and subsequently, how we apply this knowledge to our own design work. Students develop a research question and test it in field research using observation, interviews and surveys. They draw conclusions about the quality of a space and place and how to improve it. Students should leave this class with the ability to discern a problem, experience in applying their understanding of behavioral settings and the human condition to specific research foci, and the ability to use their knowledge and skills deftly in practice, where time and resources are limited. Assignments will be a mix of individual and group work, with emphasis on the latter. There will be an emphasis on reading relevant literature, field investigations and understanding research methods and collaboration for applications in practice."

Teaches imperative programming and methods for ensuring the correctness of programs. Students will learn the process and concepts needed to go from high-level descriptions of algorithms to correct imperative implementations, with specific application to basic data structures and algorithms. Much of the course will be conducted in a subset of C amenable to verification, with a transition to full C near the end. This course prepares students for 15213 and 15210. NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer Science course.

Specifically, this class delves into the new science behind networks and their concrete applications technological, biological, and social systems, as well as various design synergies that exist when looking at these systems from a cyber-physical perspective. By scope and contents, this is not just another class on ?networks?. Want to know how complex networks dominate our world? How communities arise in social networks? How group behavior dominates Twitter? How swarms of bacteria can navigate inside the human body? How patterns of interaction can be identified in hardware and software systems? Want to work on cutting edge projects involving systems and synthetic biology? Or social networks? Or networks-on-chip and internet-of-things? Then this class is for you! Course requirements consist of a few homework assignments, a semester-long project, and in-class presentations of relevant papers. By structure and contents, this class targets primarily the computer engineering and computer science students, but it also provides a valuable foundation for interdisciplinary research to students in related disciplines. Senior or graduate standing standing is required to take this course."

Combining the approach of critical theoretical study with close textual analysis, we will produce our own interpretations of early modern literary texts, drawn from different genres - drama, poetry, nonfiction prose and the novel - while considering how theory informs our reading practices. Theoretical approaches include those that explore the role of the author, those emphasizing the workings of language, such as structuralism and post-structuralism, those that approach texts as embodied performances, as well as those that underscore the relationship between texts and contexts, such as feminism, Marxism, critical race theory, and postcolonial studies."

After an introduction to warfare from the classical period through the emergence of modern armies in the 17th century, the course focuses on major global conflicts from the Seven Years War though World War Two. Topics include the gradual evolution of European thinking away from classical ideas about warfare and changing concepts of strategy, tactics, and generalship as a result of industrialization and the emergence of global economic empires."

This course gives an introduction to probability as it is used in computer science theory and practice, drawing on applications and current research developments as motivation and context. Topics include combinatorial probability and random graphs, heavy tail distributions, concentration inequalities, various randomized algorithms, sampling random variables and computer simulation, and Markov chains and their many applications, from Web search engines to models of network protocols.

Topics we will cover include: how a case gets to the court, the justices, the role of lawyers before the court, the purpose of oral argument, the court building and its symbolism, and media coverage of the court. Readings will range from newspaper and magazine stories to law review articles. At least once during the semester students will attend an oral argument, and cases currently before the court will be used as a reference point for class discussion.

Central components of the climate system that will be studied include Earth, heat budget, precipitation, the global circulation, and the mechanisms of weather. We will then survey global climate models, regional downscaling, and the process of detecting and attributing climate changes. This knowledge will be applied to explore regional climate impacts, including changes in droughts and floods, heat waves, hurricanes, Arctic climate change, and climate impacts on cities. For each type of climate change impact, adaptation efforts and barriers to adaptation will be discussed. Students will work on a team project to analyze selected regional climate adaptation efforts in more detail. Course Website: http://www.epp.cmu.edu/Users/special.html"

It is a set of tools with which firms identify good investments and decide how to pay for them. Paying for them ultimately involves getting money from households. Therefore, finance also describes the investment decisions of households and the resulting allocation of the economy's resources across firms and time. This course is the introductory finance course in the undergraduate business program. The main topics covered in the course are Financial Markets, Net Present Value, The Objective of the Firm, Discounted Cash Flow, Portfolio Theory and the Cost of Capital, The Efficient Markets Hypothesis, The Capital Structure of the Firm, and Business Valuation. Time permitting, the course will also provide an introduction to option markets and derivative securities. Upon completing the course a student will be able to consider a large and complex business problem, make some assumptions, structure the firms' cash flows in a spreadsheet, calculate the value of different solutions to the problem, and make a decision.

Faculty and students devise a personal and regular-ized meeting and task schedule. Each Research Training course is worth 9 units, which generally means a minimum for students of about 9 work-hours per week. These courses are offered only as electives; i.e., they cannot be applied toward a college or major requirement, although the units do count toward graduation as elective units. Additional details (including a roster and descriptions of Research Training Courses available in any given semester) are available in the H&SS Academic Advisory Center. Prerequisites/ restrictions: for H&SS students only; only for second-semester freshmen, or first- or second-semester sophomores; minimum cumulative QPA of 3.0 (at the time of registration) required for approved entry; additional prerequisites (e.g., language proficiency) may arise out of the particular demands of the research project in question."

By using principles and methods of analysis developed in lectures, students will complete two major projects. These projects will begin with conceptualization, proceed with the analysis of candidate designs, and culminate in the construction and testing of a prototype. The creative process will be encouraged throughout. The course is intended primarily for CIT freshmen. 3 hrs. lec., 2 hrs. rec./lab. Course Website: http://www.cmu.edu/me/undergraduate/index.html"

The Capstone should include elements that span the student's CFA and DC concentrations (for BHA students), CFA and MCS concentrations (for BSA students), or CFA and SCS concentrations (for BCSA students). The project can be either a scholarly or creative endeavor, and may take one of many possible forms (e.g., a written thesis, a compilation of creative work or works, an experiment and report, a computer program or animation, etc.). The BXA Capstone sequence covers both semesters of a student's senior year. In the fall, students are enrolled in 52401 BXA Seminar IV: Capstone Fall (9 units), which meets weekly to discuss strategies for managing research, planning the project, and larger theoretical issues related to interdisciplinary work. At the end of the fall course, students will have produced a Capstone Project proposal, an annotated bibliography, and multiple versions of their project pitch. In the spring, students enroll in 52402 BXA Seminar: Capstone Spring (9 units), which has no required classroom time. Instead, students spend the semester doing the research and foundational work necessary for the project, as well as meeting with their faculty and BXA advisors as they create their Capstone Project and prepare to present it at the annual Meeting of the Minds Undergraduate Research Symposium held each May."

The lectures will be on computational geometry that can be applied to architectural design. In addition, the lectures will focus on hands-on techniques that can be applied to the design process, to extend the efficiency and productivity of work during the process. For practical reasons, the course will use Rhinoceros, Grasshopper, Rhinoscript, and .NET framework."

The course is divided into two modules, which may be taken individually as courses 03251/02251 and 03252/02252. Module 1 covers computational molecular biology/genomics. It examines important sources of biological data, how they are archived and made available to researchers, and what computational tools are available to use them effectively in research. In the process, it covers basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. Module 2 covers computational cell biology, including biological modeling and image analysis. It includes homeworks requiring use or modification of Matlab scripts. The modeling component includes computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, neuron behavior, and stochastic simulations. The imaging component includes basics of machine vision, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models. Lectures and examinations are joint with 02250 but recitations are separate. Recitations for this course are intended primarily for biological sciences or biomedical engineering majors at the undergraduate or graduate level who have had little or no prior experience with computer science or programming. Students may not take both 03250/02250 and either 03251/02251 or 03252/02252 for credit. Prerequisite: 03121 or permission of the instructors."

The students will also learn how to calculate mechanical forces on cardiovascular tissue (blood vessels, the heart) and cardiovascular cells (endothelial cells, platelets, red and white blood cells), and the effects of those forces. Lastly, the students will learn various methods for modeling cardiac function. When applicable, students will apply these concepts to the design and function of selected medical devices (heart valves, ventricular assist devices, artificial lungs)."

We will work with historical data sets to \"discover\" Malthusian economics and model economic relationships that governed the human condition up until the mid-1700's. We will then move on to the industrial revolution and \"discover\" the role of technology, culminating in an overview of modern thinking about economic growth. Questions we will consider as well as looking at looking at the current public policy responses to them are: Why are some countries rich and some are poor? Why have some countries experienced rapid economic development; what can be done to foster development of others that continue to languish? Does education lead to increased household wealth and national wealth? How are new technologies affecting economic development and economic opportunities? Can we improve design of electronic markets to take advantage of the vast opportunities for trade and exchange afforded by by the internet?

Students are also expected to learn the basic components of Chinese characters as well as their origins and cultural implications. Activities related to the broad spectrum of Chinese culture will be organized to facilitate language learning. This course can substitute for 82232 for the Chinese major and minor.

Other possibilities include local hospitals, museums, theatre and other arts groups, software documentation firms and other groups needing technical writers and communications specialists, PR and ad agencies, law-related sites, and just about any place you can think of that requires writing and communication skills. Most of your class time for the course will be completed through work at your internship site a minimum of 120 hours (8-10 per week) over the semester for 9 units of credit. As the academic component of the course, you'll keep a reflective journal and meet periodically with the internship coordinator to discuss your internship and related professional issues. You will be responsible for finding your own internship, but it is recommended that you set up a meeting with the instructor to talk about your interests and what opportunities are open to you. You should do this before registration week."

Despite this diversity of applications, there are core technology and system-level skills needed by any embedded system designer that form the content of this course. The emphasis of this course will be at the system layer where hardware meets software, with plenty of hands-on experience at \"bare metal\" programming. Topics typically covered include embedded computing platforms (hardware, microcontroller instruction sets, software in both assembly language and C); interacting with the external world (analog I/O, digital I/O, serial ports, filtering, control, embedded networks); system-level engineering (design cycle, architectural patterns, peer reviews); real-time operation (timers, interrupts, concurrency, task switching, writing a simple RTOS kernel, scheduling); constraints and optimization (economics, power, performance); and a survey of techniques important for building systems that work in the real world (debug, test, robust design, dependability, safety, ethical/societal issues). Weekly hands-on hardware and software experiences with a 16-bit microcontroller module will tie directly to lectures to reinforce core skills. 4 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec., 3 hrs. lab.

A few lectures at the beginning of the course will introduce the process, tools, and documents to be used in the course, all of which will be specified by the instructors. Throughout the project, groups will be mentored through weekly team meetings with faculty. Students will make regular presentations, and will be evaluated on the code delivered, software engineering process, client satisfaction, and their contribution to the team. Students will leave the course with a firsthand understanding of the software engineering realities that drive SE practices. They will have concrete experience with these practices, and will have engaged in active reflection on this experience. They will have teamwork, process, and product skills to support immediate competency in a software engineering organization, along with a deeper understanding that prepares them to evaluate the new processes and techniques they will encounter in the workplace.

Learning how materials and techniques inform spatial and form making decisions will be a central theme to the semester. Lectures and discussions will focus on the meaning, aesthetics and techniques related to the use of materials and the process of construction. Field trips will provide further depth into these topics. A basic understanding of essential, well-known systems of building construction will be our base line. Discussions and case studies of contemporary systems that extend, experiment and question these known systems will introduce you to the great depth to which this basic knowledge can lead you. Joint assignments with the second year design studio will provide you with an opportunity for an in-depth exploration of these fundamentals of construction through a direct application and synthesis of this new knowledge to your studio project. This course will introduce a basic understanding, selection, design, preliminary sizing and methodology of construction systems organized by the 16 divisions of construction, as defined by the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) as well as and introduction to the International Building Code (IBC) with special attention given to fire protection, types of construction, and means of egress."

Economic crisis, impoverishment, rising inequality, environmental degradation, pandemic disease, and militant ethnic, religious, and nationalist movements are just as much a part of the contemporary global landscape as are technological innovation, instantaneous communication, shifts in the global division of labor, the creation of new wealth and knowledge, the promotion and defense of human rights, and the rise of cosmopolitan values and perspectives.

Starting from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python programming language, including its standard libraries and programming paradigms. We will also target numerous deployment scenarios, including standalone programs, shell scripts, and web-based applications. This course assumes no prior programming experience. Even so, it is a fast-paced and rigorous preparation for 15122. Students seeking a more gentle introduction to computer science should consider first taking 15110. NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer Science course."

The culture commonly associated with the French language is the primarily Christian and Cartesian European tradition. Through this course, students will learn about the socio-political and cultural realities of the Francophone sphere. The course will also explore the multiple synthetic cultural realities which have arisen through the colonial and post-colonial processes of contact between European and non-European cultures, and which are now expressed through the medium of the French language. Students will expand their interpersonal and presentational communication skills in both written and spoken French, improve reading and listening skills through various media so as to analyze content objectively, use appropriate vocabulary and grammar to express critical judgments, synthesize ideas from different source materials, and continue perfecting cultural analysis skills. Assignments will include using accepted academic conventions for research documentation and exposition. Social debates and current events will add a valuable perspective to our study.

In this course, we look at the history and development of the idea of citizenship in a cross-cultural perspective, focusing on the global interconnections that influence the forms that citizenship takes. We will examine the roots of political citizenship in Western society, and compare these to other foundational notions of state-subject relationships (such as in the Ancient Near East and Ancient China). We then consider the formation of European nation-states and the emergence of modern citizenships. In the second half of the course, we use examples from across the world to think about how subjects experience citizenship in particular ways, paying special attention to the margins and borders of citizenship (refugees, migrants, internally displaced peoples, cultural minorities, economically disadvantaged communities, etc.). The class is discussion-based, and students will complete short assignments and a final essay."

Linguistics is the name given to the science of language, whose task it is to give such a description. The discipline of linguistics has developed novel tools for describing and analyzing language over the last two hundred years and in this course we learn what these tools are and practice applying them. Sub-areas of linguistics which we study include phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the study of sound systems), morphology (the study of parts of words), and syntax (the study of combinations of words). Beyond this, we look at changes in language over time, and we consider the puzzle of linguistic meaning. The methods of linguistics are useful in the study of particular languages and in the study of language generally, so this course is useful for students of foreign languages as well as those interested in going on to study language acquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and computer modeling of language."

Throughout the term students will be introduced to a history of social strife in the North of Ireland from the 1960s to the present, and efforts to reconcile differences in the contemporary period. We will consider the influence of advancing technology on how narratives are shared within a community and worldwide. We will reflect upon and analyze a variety of literary and visual art sources from the chosen time period, while also learning how to create mixed-media projects using Gigapan and Hear Me systems from Carnegie Mellon?s CREATE Lab in the Robotics Institute. If you have ever considered how artists explore societal strife through their writing or visual arts practice, if you are interested in the social and political influences of evolving technology, or if you are a practicing artist who uses advancing technology as a tool for individual expression, this integrative course is for you. Throughout the semester we will examine the practice of a range of visual artists that include Rita Duffy, John Kindness and Willie Doherty and writers and dramatists like Dermot Healy, Patrick McCabe and Christina Reid. Students will learn how to use CREATE Lab?s Gigapan and Hear Me systems as platforms for exploring the content presented in class and for the development of final projects. We will travel to Belfast for spring break 2015, to meet a variety of writers and artists whose work we will study, and stakeholders in reconciliation efforts throughout the region. In addition to weekly lectures on Thursdays throughout the term, students will have a six-week lab on Tuesdays."

It aims to help students obtain a general understanding of the various Chinese folk performance forms including puppetry, opera, oral storytelling traditions, and temple festival performances. It will also explore the culture of folk performance, dramatic literature, and performing arts, their relationship with Chinese local culture and societies, and their national and global impact. Class activities will include lectures, guest speakers, and discussion, as well as presentation of multimedia examples of folk performances. At the end of the course, students are expected to have a better understanding of the nature and scope of the Chinese folk performance traditions and gain some fundamental training that will enable them to carry on related fieldwork and research."

The course is focused entirely on project design work (this is not an historical survey, technical or lecture course). This course is very hands-on Projects will explore the design and experience of spatial environments through a series of creative investigations. The semester will be broken in to 3 parts:Intro/Exploration and a long term project. In Intro/Exploration, students will have many hands on opportunities to start to build a common language to describe spacial investigations as well as creating them. This will consist of short projects, with each design investigation progressively building upon the previous exploration; these early projects will consist of both individual and group work. They will focus on Making. The second half of the semester will consist of one long term project to be created individually, incorporating students? personal theories of architecture based on an overarching question. Studio work will be supported by group discussion based upon critical review of student work, readings, slide presentations, videos and films. There will also be a few field trips. Students are encouraged to explore their own areas of interest with respect to their work in class. Self-motivation, class attendance and an open mind is mandatory, however, no prior architectural, engineering or artistic experience is required. Students are expected to perform work both inside and outside of class. Students should be prepared to purchase various supplies throughout the course. This course is in partial fulfillment of requirements for an Architecture Minor."

That impact can take the form of a product, a change in practice, or a legal statute. The application should have a theoretical base, as contrasted, say, with pure measurement research as in ergonomics. Examples of applications are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors based on models of cognitive processing, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measurses of consumers' implicit attitudes. The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting. The questions to be considered include: What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable? What is the pathway from laboratory to practice? What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice? The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students."

It seeks to help you hone your writing and thinking skills as you produce pieces of substance that reflect those traditions and standards. As a published author, foreign correspondent and Pulitzer-Prize winning editor, the instructor has been a foot soldier in print journalism and media management for 30 years. The practical emphasis of the course reflects his extensive and varied background. The course focuses on the four stages necessary to any nonfiction story: idea, concept, reporting and writing. Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalism's glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy. The last segment of the course examines the evolution of journalism in the digital age and the impact that is having on the media landscape, particularly print. Students will be given assistance and encouragement as they seek outlets for their writings and connections in the media world that could lead to internships and employment."

What does it take, technically, to achieve net zero and what else, beyond technical requirements, advances or impedes a net zero future? 48752 is a graduate level class that explores net zero energy design and construction in the residential sector. Through case studies and applied projects, we will explore what it takes to achieve quantitative net zero in residential buildings while maintaining occupant comfort and satisfaction. In locations where net zero is now required, we will examine the results of those requirements. At the outset, we will discuss specific definitions of a net-zero building and the implications of each definition. Through case studies, lectures, field trips, outside reading and assignments, we will examine how a net-zero building is achieved, including the use of renewable energy to achieve the net-zero balance. We will apply lessons learned from metered examples to real sites and to new design or renovation projects in Pittsburgh and will use simulation software to test and quantify the impact of our design/renovation strategies. We will also compare our strategies to requirements in US codes and rating systems such as IECC-2012 and LEED for Homes to evaluate their impact in moving the US residential sector toward much higher performance buildings. Although our focus is residential, many of the concepts and strategies we cover have parallels in the commercial sector. Students who enroll in the class must know how to calculate without software heat loss and heat gain for a small building. You are also expected to have a fundamental understanding of residential design and construction, plan reading and mechanical systems; US residential materials and construction methods for net zero will be covered in class."

This course explores how neurons encode and process information, adapt and learn, communicate, cooperate, compete and compute at the individual level as well as at the levels of networks and systems. It will introduce basic concepts in computational modeling, information theory, signal processing, system analysis, statistical and probabilistic inference. Concrete examples will be drawn from the visual system and the motor systems, and studied from computational, psychological and biological perspectives. Students will learn to perform computational experiments using Matlab and quantitative studies of neurons and neuronal networks."

Topics vary from semester to semester, aiming to provide a thorough understanding of Latin American, Spanish and U.S. cultures in connection to issues such as race, gender, socio-economic class. Students will improve their language use (reading, speaking, writing, and listening). Prerequisites: two out of the following three courses, 82342, 82342 or 82344, or permission of instructor FALL 2015: Cities and Spaces in the Spanish-speaking World: Mapping Identities, Self and Other This course focuses on the city in the Spanish-speaking world, using representations of urban landscapes in literature, film and photography as a lens to study identities and cultures. Cities are a principal organizing unit of society, the site of concentrated political and economic power, spaces that have fostered intense creativity; urban centers have functioned as sites of inclusion and exclusion, of opportunity and marginalization. The course will examine cities in Pre-Colombian times, and then consider their importance during Colonial times, as Spain's Empire was considered to be very urban. Students will explore the significance of the city in the formation of national identities from the 19th through the early 20th century, and then move to more contemporary times, which have seen an explosion of urbanization and the transformation of many cities. At present, Latin America is the most urbanized region in the world, with 80% of its population residing in cities, a figure expected to jump to 90% by 2050. While looking broadly across Spain, Latin America and the US, special consideration will be given to Barcelona, Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Santiago, New York and Los Angeles."

Some of the questions we will consider include: Are developed countries like ours obligated to ameliorate poverty by providing foreign aid, are they obligated to prevent environmental problems, and is globalization and free trade in particular a good idea? The course uses theory, case studies, and empirical evidence to consider these questions from a few different moral and political perspectives.

Modules on molecular physiology tissue engineering and physiological modeling are also included. Due to the close interrelationship between structure and function in biological systems, each functional topic will be introduced through a brief exploration of anatomical structure. Basic physical laws and principles will be explored as they relate to physiologic function. Prerequisite or co-requisite: 03121 Modern Biology, or permission of instructor."

If the victory of the Chinese Communist Party and development of the socialist state are to be considered in historical context, it is necessary to first understand the political, cultural, economic and intellectual currents that immediately preceded them. During the second half of the course, we will examine the Maoist period (19491976). We will investigate the Chinese Communist Party as both a state-building institution and an engine of social transformation, and consider the tensions these dual roles produced. Finally, we will look at the Reform Period (1978-present), and reflect on a newly robust China's attempts to come to terms with its own recent past and what the consequences might be for both China and the world."

Two modeling methodologies will be presented: 1) Models, both static and dynamic, that can be implemented as mathematical expressions in a spreadsheet; and 2) discrete-event models that utilize the event scheduling formalism. @Risk, from Palisade Corporation, is the tool that will be used to demonstrate how to build and execute spreadsheet simulation and Arena, from Rockwell Software, is the tool that will be used to demonstrate how to build discrete-event simulation models for service and manufacturing applications. Upon completion of the course students will be able to carry out the entire process of designing the model, implementing it in the appropriate software, executing the simulation, collecting and analyzing output data, and using the results of the analysis to evaluate alternative decisions."

The psychological theories underlying these behaviors will be examined as well as their impact on the lives of stigmatized individuals. Its goal is to examine a number of social differences and understand how prejudice can impact many areas of society. In addition to the traditional forms of prejudice based on such things as race, gender and age; other inequalities that result from less traditional groupings such as social class, appearance, and disability and will be explored. Research on issues of social identity, intergroup relations and the reduction of prejudice will be examined through readings and class activities."

This new scientific approach has the potential of providing important information about how the brain thinks, indicating not only what parts perform what function, but also how the activity of different parts of the brain are organized to perform some thinking task, and how various neurological diseases (e.g. aphasia, Alzheimer's) affect brain activity. A variety of different types of thinking will be examined, including short-term working memory storage and computation, problem solving, language comprehension, visual thinking. Several different technologies for measuring brain activity (e.g. PET and functional MRI and also some PET imaging) will be considered, attempting to relate brain physiology to cognitive functioning. The course will examine brain imaging in normal subjects and in people with various kinds of brain damage."

In the process, it will cover basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics to be covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. Lectures and examinations are joint with 02251 but recitations are separate. Recitations for this course are intended primarily for biological sciences or biomedical engineering majors at the undergraduate or graduate level who have had little or no prior experience with computer science or programming. Students may not take both 03251/02251 and 03250/02250 for credit. Prerequisite: 03121 or permission of the instructor."

Topics in healthcare business intelligence (BI) to be covered include how data quality and data governance improve the quality of healthcare, architectural implications of BI, technology management, and how BI facilitates evidence-based medicine and effective clinical decision support. Besides gaining hands-on lab experience with BI technologies and tools used in real-world healthcare organizations, students will also work on a group project to understand better the challenges that big (and unstructured) data present to traditional clinical database systems."

This core is universal and is the source of the connection that all people can feel with something well made. It is the source of an intrinsic meaning that handmade objects have and that all people understand. This class will attempt to connect the inexperienced maker with the universal meanings that emerge in objects made by hand. It will teach you to trust your eye, hand, and intuition which is the substance of self-reliance. Constructing an object from scratch provides deep personal satisfaction. This furniture studio will seek to generate form in direct response to the material, guided by the capabilities of machines and tools available, while responding to ergonomic considerations. The emphasis will be on the use hand tools and power machinery. There will be two main projects for the semester. A table made of straight components and a student selected piece made of curved and shaped parts. Students will conduct a surveys of modern sculptors and furniture to understand the context of studio furniture. The studio will require hand labor in drawing, design and fabrication. Computers may be used to assist design to ease the labor, but the final rendition of the design will be hand drawn full size on ply. This will serve to establish important links between hand and eye/mind, perception and intuition, touch and understanding, The development of these connections between body and nervous system must be established, practiced and reinforced through repetition. It promotes muscle memory that is so essential in all sports and performance skills. Similarly this linkage connects the eye with hand to make drawing more automatic and the representation of an idea /image more spontaneous and expressive."

We will discuss the economic function of contracts and, when contracts fail or are not feasible, the role of legal remedies to resolve disputes. We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such aas regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differ from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs.

We expect that the government and others around us respect certain rights we have, we acknowledge some communal obligations when pay our taxes or establish welfare programs, and we participate in democratic processes. But what are we talking about, when we speak of \"rights\"? Or \"justice\"? Why do we assume that democracy is good? The ideas we invoke along the way \u2014 justice, equality, rights, democracy, progress \u2014 these are the subjects of political philosophy. In this seminar we will interrogate some of these ideas by examining traditions in Western political thought and the challenges to some of these traditions from more contemporary authors. We will begin by reading some classical texts in the social contract tradition, and dissents from anarchist, communist, and feminist thinkers. We will think about whether individuals do in fact or should have \"rights.\" We will read philosophical reflections on political revolutions and political change. We will investigate justifications for democratic government. Finally, we will turn out attention to some of the most pressing challenges of our age: multiculturalism, identity politics, and justice as it relates to race and gender."

Because of the emphasis upon integration, this course will center around system integration in which small teams of students will configure, design, and implement a succession of mechatronic subsystems, leading to a main project. Lectures will complement the laboratory experience with comparative surveys, operational principles, and integrated design issues associated with the spectrum of mechanism, electronics, and control components. Class lectures will cover topics intended to complement the laboratory work, including mechanisms, actuators, motor drives, sensors and electronic interfaces, microcontroller hardware and programming and basic controls. During the first week of class, each student will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their technical background. The class will then be divided into multi-disciplinary teams of three students. During the first half of the class, lab assignments will be made every 1-2 weeks to construct useful subsystems based on material learned in lecture. The lab assignments are geared to build to the main project. This course is cross-listed as 16778 and 24778. Students in other departments may take the course upon availability of slots with permission of instructor. Non ECE students may take the course upon availability of slots with permission of the instructor."

Readings will include a wide variety of secondary and primary historical sources from different time periods. We will also view and discuss several films (including Frederick Wiseman's 1973 classic, \"Juvenile Court\"). As opportunities develop, we may also hear from current court practitioners as guest lecturers. The course will be discussion-based. I will do very little formal lecturing, and I expect students to take on increasing responsibility for launching and guiding class discussions as the semester progresses. Evaluation will be based on in-class mid-term and final exams, several oral presentations and brief writing assignments, and contributions to class discussion."

Which measure in a phrase is felt as a main goal, especially when the phrase contains an unusual number of measures? How can multiple tempi be meaningfully related? Among many important formal arrival points, which are the most important? In addition to these questions, we will also look at recent work on ways in which 18th-century musicians may have understood meter very differently from most musicians today. These alternate perspectives open new possibilities for hearing and shaping the flow of musical time in baroque and classical music. These issues will be pursued from two directions. We will develop simple theoretical tools that can make score analysis a helpful input to the decisions that performers make about such questions. We will also examine audio and video recordings by famous artists to see both how they dealt with these issues and what new questions are raised. Week-to-week work will include reading, listening, and score analysis. Students will write term papers that either use one of the main perspectives developed in class (starting from scores or starting from recordings) or else combine the two. They will also give presentations about their projects to the class."

This multi-disciplinary course aims to develop energy-literate students, introduce them to best practices in communicating scientific concepts, and bring them into contact with schools and community organizations as places to further spread the word about energy. In partnership with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Science & Engineering Ambassadors program, each week students will meet and interact with different energy-related Ambassadors, including academic researchers, professional engineers, and corporate leaders. Along with exposure to numerous topics in energy sources, production, distribution, and use, students will have an opportunity to discuss the complex problems facing energy policy and infrastructure, and learn about best practices for effective science communication. All students in the course will participate in at least one public outreach session to engage in dialogue with community members, such as secondary-school students, in some aspect of energy and how it relates to their lives."

While this technique is found in many video games and vfx movies, it has the ability to create endless possibilities within the realm of computer graphics and experimental animation/art. Students will also become more familiar with the process of rendering to create the necessary polish for their animations/visualizations. CG Lighting, camera work, and material shading are just a few of the many topics covered in this course."

Concerned more with those whose lives are outside of the traditional spot-light, literary journalism enriches our sense of who inhabits the contemporary world. Reading the stories of other lives can help us understand our own, by enlarging and deepening the context in which we understand our humanity. In this class, you will read a variety of professional literary journalism, and be asked to write your own. You'll have chances to interview people you know, and don?t know, and write their stories, along with an assignment that invites you to capture your family history. You'll write about Pittsburgh places, and you'll learn how the stories of your own life can become literary journalism when you learn to contextualize them, and connect them to larger issues. The concerns and goals of Literary Journalism overlap with memoir, creative non-fiction, and magazine writing. The class is run as a seminar and demands high level of student involvement.

The objective of this course, which includes classroom and laboratory sessions, is to define approaches to quantifying the populations and properties of defects in crystals. The course will be divided into three sections: point defects, dislocations, and planar defects. The formation of point defects and their influence on diffusion, electrical, and magnetic properties will be considered. The properties and characteristics of dislocations and dislocation reactions will be presented, with a focus on the role of dislocations in deformation. The crystallography and energetics of planar defects and interfaces will also be described, with a focus on microstructural evolution at high temperatures. Time permitting, volume defects or other special topics are also discussed."

Nevertheless, over the centuries, many have succumbed to the temptation to try to design languages of their own. Some have tried to improve upon the perceived inadequacies of available natural languages (e.g., Zamenhof's Esperanto and Brown's Loglan), while others have sought to imitate nature, creating their own languages for artistic purposes (e.g., Tolkien?s Elvish languages, Okrand?s Klingon, and Peterson?s Dothraki and Valyrian). In this course, we will explore the linguistic considerations involved in language invention, along with the linguistic lessons of the history of language construction attempts, with a particular emphasis on applying these insights to our own invented languages. Activities will include the development of one or more major components of the grammar of a new invented language, along with problem sets that provide general linguistic background and more limited exercises in language design. This course does not assume any background in linguistics, and is intended to accommodate both newcomers and advanced students."

The Southwest conjures different images, perhaps of adobe pueblos, Spanish friars, arid ranches, and the color turquoise. The built environment of the Midwest, the California coast, the Mississippi Delta, and many places in between reflect particular regional identities that have been both unconsciously and consciously created over time. This course examines the historical development of regional patterns in the American built environment. It investigates how and why a regions architectural identity evolved in the ways that it did. To what degree is place something to respond to, to interact with, and to what degree is place something that is created? Our focus will be primarily pre-20th century when the forces of vernacular traditions were stronger, we will also examine more recent trends of regionalism as an aesthetic choice and a theoretical stance."

Students will develop contextually appropriate interpersonal communication skills in both written and spoken Russian, develop reading and listening skills through various media (video, ML server, Internet), understand and begin to control fundamental grammar, acquire vocabulary, and gain a basic understanding of Russian culture. The elementary level is also designed to help students learn to reflect and draw upon strategies employed by good language learners in their second language study. Daily homework and participation in class are mandatory (four in-class hours per week), as is weekly consultation and conversation practice with a peer language assistant. In case of schedule conflict, please contact Professor Castellano at cc62@andrew.cmu.edu. A student with prior experience in Russian must take the placement exam. Instructions for the placement exam are available in Baker Hall 160. Prerequisite: 82191 or placement"

We will first document and review the underlying theory for three conceptual departures from the standard model -non-standard preferences (e.g., present-bias, reference dependence), non-standard beliefs (e.g., overconfidence, gambler''s fallacy), and non-standard decision-making (e.g., heuristics, emotions, framing effects)-and then quickly move to assess the evidence for these claims in field settings. We will additionally explore how markets respond to behavioral biases, and discuss recent research in behavioral policy with an emphasis on policies aimed at increasing savings, improving food choice, and heightening program take-up and compliance. The course will be paper-centric and we will review a variety of popular empirical methods from field experiments to quasi-experimental approaches (e.g., estimation through regression-based panel analyses, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables). Student evaluation will be based on performance on problem sets, an exam, as well as a short class presentation of an empirical paper of choice."

We continue to emphasize architectural drawing and models (both analog and digital) as the primary means of architectural communication, but also as a method of creatively exploring and rigorously testing fundamental architectural ideas. We investigate, research, analyze, diagram, and apply lessons from local architecture, and great architecture of the past, in studio, and in the parallel survey of architectural history. We introduce the use of ?systems,? ?computational thinking,? and ?rules? in the design process to create order, deal with a range of parameters, and satisfy specific performance criteria. Beginning with more abstract formal design exercises, and ending with the design of a small building, we explore how tectonics, joinery, materials, as well as site, orientation, context, and human use can be harnessed to inspire great design. The design process is still carefully controlled, but students are encouraged to begin to speculate and take careful risks."

For the materials used in each application, the selection and performance criteria will be considered as well as the underlying structure, thermodynamic, and kinetic processes that influence materials properties. The effects of irradiation on materials properties and performance will be examined. Key properties include strength, fracture toughness and corrosion resistance. Many of these properties continue to change over the long service periods expected of components. In addition to lectures and homeworks, each student will complete a detailed case study in which they examine a particular material and application."

The course uses lectures, readings, group exercises, and an individual project with instructor feedback to achieve the learning objectives. The primary work in this course is hands-on application of the material by the student to create a strategic marketing plan for their own, approved product innovation idea with evaluation and feedback from the instructor. A customer-centric orientation is emphasized throughout the course. The course addresses strategic marketing decisions and activities including identifying value creation opportunities; generating and selecting innovation ideas; understanding the market, competition, customer needs and customer experience; segmenting, targeting markets; developing a positioning strategy and compelling customer value proposition; making marketing-mix decisions for product, pricing, route-to-market/distribution, and customer base development. The perspective of this course will be from a role of a strategic marketer, which is typically held by an entrepreneur/CEO, product manager, strategic marketing manager, product planning manager, new business development manager, or innovation manager. A syllabus and project description are available from the instructor."

It asks: what are the social and cognitive processes, what are the conscious and unconscious problem-solving strategies we use: to comprehend and interpret text, to construct and communicate our own meanings, and to project or discover our readers' responses? In the first half of the course we look at writers and designers as thinkers and problem solvers-facing the challenge of equally creative, meaning-making readers and their own constructive, interpretive processes of comprehension. Understanding (and user-testing for) how readers actually interpret texts is critical to many kinds of writing, from informative websites and PR work, to persuasive applications and powerful arguments. An introduction to the research and theory on reading and writing as a social/cognitive process lets us explore the why behind the what readers do. For instance, you will learn how memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge can shape and are shaped by language and discourse as socially constructed mediating tools. At the same time you will develop a portfolio of methods that track the constructive, inferential process of readers' comprehension. In the second half of the course we turn to you and your own writing as a thinking process engaged in the constant effort to juggle competing goals. You will gain insight into your current problem-solving strategies and develop new ones for doing reader-based writing and design. The final project (which studies your own process on a current writing task) will expand your portfolio of methods into a toolkit of expert strategies for 1) both composing and communication and for 2) user testing and inquiry into the comprehension of real readers that uncovers how others actually interpret what you thought you said."

Emphasis is placed on how membrane traffic is regulated and where applicable how it is disrupted or subverted during disease processes. The course is of general interest to students, fellows, and faculty interested in cell biology, immunology, neurobiology, pharmacology and virology."

Diffraction measurements are studied as tools to quantify crystal lattices, including Bragg's law and structure factors. Diffraction from amorphous substances and liquids is also introduced. The various types of atomic bonding, e.g., Van der Waals, metallic, ionic, covalent and hydrogen are surveyed. Binding energies of some crystalline structures are calculated. Models of crystal binding are generalized to include dynamics, first for classical lattice vibrations and then for quantized lattice vibrations known as phonons. These concepts are used to calculate the heat capacities of insulating crystals, to introduce the concept of density of states, and to discuss phonon scattering. The band theory of solids is developed, starting with the free electron model of a metal and culminating with the properties of conductors and semiconductors. Magnetic phenomena such as paramagnetism and the mean field theory of ferromagnetism are covered to the extent that time permits."

This course fosters understanding about Arab cultural dynamics and appreciating cultural differences within the Arab World and between Arab and Western societies, with the aim of bridging these differences. Prerequisite: None FALL 2015: Arab Cultural Issues and Active Agency in Modern Arab Society The Arab World comprises many North African and Middle Eastern countries with multiple ethnicities and a long, rich history. This course raises awareness of many Arab cultural issues in light of the historical, economic, social, and political characteristics that distinguish the modern Arab World. The course begins with the East-West discourse and the creation of stereotypes, Sa\u00efd's theory on Orientalism, being a \"careful reader\" of the literature and media that may create such stereotypes, and how to go beyond them so as to gain a true understanding of the hybrid nature of Arab societies. The course will then discuss the key religious and cultural beliefs and customs, and the challenges that construct Arab thought and relations (family- marriage- sexuality). The selected readings will highlight Arab men and women writers' roles as social critics of the sometimes injustices endured under a dominant patriarchal social system. There will also be an appreciation of Arab artistic creativity (photography, painting, calligraphy). The course material will vary between newspapers and critical articles, novels, films, and documentaries. Students will have the opportunity to engage in a video-conference dialogue with students in the American University in Cairo and other students from Arab countries. Grades will be based on attendance and participation, weekly journal entries, a presentation, and a final paper. Class discussion and readings in English."

The course as whole encourages class participation and discussion in a seminar-type fashion. The course begins with a historical review of the subject followed by a review of vector and tensor analysis, before discussing various measures of deformation and stress formulations. The development and understanding of appropriate constitutive models for particular problems are at the core of this course. Both analytical and to some extent experimental results are presented through readings from reports in recent journals and the relevance of these results to the solution of unsolved problems is highlighted. The main objective of this course is to provide the basic ideas of continuum mechanics for engineering and science students with little or no background in Biomechanics, with particular emphasis on the application of quantitative and system perspectives to fluid and solid mechanics problems. In addition to looking at various examples with biomechanics applications, the last few weeks of the course are dedicated to discussing individually-crafted research projects for the students.

This course will use ethnographic writings (descriptive accounts of particular cultures), as well as ethnographic films, to investigate the ways in which diverse societies structure family life, resolve conflict, construct gender relations, organize subsistence, etc. We will assess the advantages and pitfalls of comparing cross-cultural data, analyze the workings of power within and between societies, and consider the politics of cultural representations. We will also discuss the anthropologist's relationship to the people s/he studies, and the responsibilities inherent in that relationship. Throughout the course, students will learn the importance of an historical perspective on culture, looking at how and why societies change, and considering how we, as anthropologists, should assess these changes."

Each module contains a guest lecture, event attendance, and follow-up discussion which serve as points of entry into each discipline as well as points of comparison within the arts as a whole. These three components provide a direct link between theory and practice allowing students to gain a critical vocabulary to discuss their experiences. Outside of class, supplementary readings, audience participation, and written reflections provide an opportunity for students to use course material to enrich their own artistic practice. Ultimately, students are asked to consider their roles as an artist: within their discipline, within the arts, and within the broader community.

            "desc": "Today if something causes a \"sensation,\" it gives us a rush of excitement, a public uproar, a scandalous controversy, a terrifying threat, all magnified to us by electronic and global media. How should we think about, as opposed to merely reacting to, such sensations that preoccupy both public media and personal fears and fantasies? This course will show that \"sensation culture\" began in the 19th century and has been ever since a key part of mass culture up to the sensations of the present. At the center of very different public \"sensations\" there could be serial killers, astonishing scientific discoveries, daring visions of revolutionary transformation, revelations of devastating poverty and over-the-top luxury and wealth. Sensations powerfully affect the feelings, body, and imagination whether they are exploitative media concoctions or staggering revelations of the most serious social and natural secrets. We will read across this range of Victorian sensations\u2014from Dickens? Oliver Twist and the 1% vs. the 99%, to the jolt produced by new theories of evolution (Darwin and Chambers), to alarming visions of revolution (Marx and Engels), to terrifying domestic secrets revealed in \"sensation novels,\" to the advent of the serial killer (Jack the Ripper and Mr. Hyde), to anthropologies of disease and death. We will see all of these in relation to the new Victorian mass print media that constructed these and other \"sensations\" to contemporary readers. Readings in recent theory will help us raise conceptual issues about what makes a sensation and why some current cases (think epidemic, terror, climate change, vast inequality) help us grasp the history of producing and responding to painfully serious or pleasurably spectacular \"sensations.\""

It begins with the cataclysm of WWII and the fundamental shifts it caused on the conception of modernism, technology, cities, and geo-politics. It proceeds to investigate themes such as rebuilding and reconstruction, grand modern masters such as Mies, Kahn, and Le Corbusier, the fascination with technology, megastructures and utopian thought, the need for monumentality, meaning, and regional identity, and the dissemination of modernism from corporate America to the third world. It ends with the rupture in modernism associated with the social revolutions and the rise of a post-modern architecture in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The course includes lectures, readings, and discussions to define the unique character of the postwar period, as modernism both reigned supreme, and began to be questioned. Emphasis will be placed on the relationship of buildings to the more general cultural, intellectual, and historical circumstances in which they were created. Special attention will be devoted throughout the course to the important manifestoes, theoretical and critical writings that so determined the project of modern architecture. Work for the course involves extensive reading, preparing for class discussions, and a major research paper."

The solutions of these problems require a rigorous concept of computability that is fundamental for computer science as well as cognitive science. We first discuss predicate logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs. That is followed by the formal development of elementary set theory and the proof of the incompleteness theorems for that theory. Then, the concept of Turing machine computation is introduced and shown to be equivalent to the concept of a recursive function. That provides the mathematical tools for establishing the results mentioned above. The mathematical and computational notions and results are among the most significant contributions of logic, not just to the solution of internal logical questions and to the foundations of computer science, but also to the beginnings of a deeper understanding of the human mind and mental processes. In addition to the mathematical developments, we will discuss historical and philosophical aspects of the subject."

Commedia dell'Arte gives them the tools to tackle physical comedy from any era, past or present. In the second half of the term students discover their personal Clowns. This clown has nothing to do with the American Barnum & Bailey Circus clown; this is not a character or caricature, but rather a revelation of the clown each student hides under the mask of adulthood. Discovering this clown gives them all a way to laugh at themselves, to uncover what makes each individual uniquely funny; it also lets them see how we only laugh at truth and in the personal material lies universal humor. Inside this freedom is the technique to know what's funny and why, and the ability to apply these rules in comedy."

How does high culture interact with folk culture and popular culture? How have education and language policies shaped Chinese cultural identities over the last century? What does it mean to be Chinese in a diaspora context? Secondary readings, primary documents, and video material chosen for analysis will provide students with important insights into the diverse factors that have been shaping contemporary Chinese culture. This course is conducted in English with no requirement of prior knowledge of Chinese language for students who take it for 9 units. Students who take this course towards fulfillment of requirements for the Chinese major or minor must register for 12 units requiring completion of three (3) units of study in Chinese Studies.

Through a small number of exploratory assignments and a public capstone project, students will bolster interdisciplinary problem-solving abilities and explore computation as a medium for curiosity-driven experimentation. Enrolling students are expected to have demonstrable programming skills, without exception, beyond the level of an introductory class such as 15110.

What are the major actors in the international political arena of the 21st century? What are the characteristics of governmental, non-governmental, and intergovernmental actors engaged in international policy making? Can we somewhat appraise the type of international system that we will live under during the next decades? Will the United States continue to be a major global power? In order to take advantage of our location in Washington, I will bring in practitioners from different policy communities to speak to us about their work.

This broad introductory course to general history through the prism of literature and politics aims at appreciating humanism and identity from the distant past on. 1. It discusses the significance of language and speech aptitude as a primordial and universal trait upon which rests the possibility of association and organization. This aptitude has made humans history conscious. 2. It explores some basic facts about the pre-19th century Western tradition of governance and the place of the individual within it, along with the expansion of these European states into the world in the aftermath of the maritime navigation and colonial conquest. An emphasis is placed on the pivotal European movements of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. The first, with its humanism in the 16th century, promoted a sense of identity associated with the language spoken in one\u00bfs area and the rise from the old medieval notion of suzerainty of the local gentry over local communities to the sovereignty of the monarchy of the area, thereby the nation state. The second, the 18th century Enlightenment, led to reforms and revolutions. These transformations, including the growth of literacy, have significantly marked Europe and subsequently the rest of the world that experienced European domination or influence. All this has resulted in the making of broad communities of European language speakers who are not of European descent."

Examples of such industries are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications and e-commerce. We will explore the unique economic circumstances facing firms in these industries and identify strategies that enable firms to succeed given these circumstances. You will learn to analyze pricing strategies including versioning and bundling; product standardization decisions; managing product complements; exploiting network effects; managing platform competition. This course will help you understand the unique economic characteristics seen in today's technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. We will study, for example: Why firms in the IT industry give away their best products for free. Why makers of video gaming consoles subsidize end users (but tax game developers) while computer operating system makers subsidize software developers (but overcharge end users).

            "desc": "Although rhetoric and law have long been closely associated, the modern professionalization of law has often promoted the idea that legal discourse is not rhetorical at all but instead an objective, value-neutral science that can be applied independent of social or political influence. This view of legal discourse is disputed by critics who point out the figurative aspects of legal language, the importance of character, emotion, and narrative in legal discourse, and the ways in which law protects structures of power such as race, class, and gender privilege. In this course we will examine the often fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which legal discourse is directed to global audiences, particularly the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect ideals of democracy to suit particular geopolitical goals. We will begin by studying the ways in which desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States was influenced by cold war politics, then we will study the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed rulers in emerging democracies have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that the society observes the \"rule of law.\" Alongside primary sources of legal rhetoric, we will study a selection of interdisciplinary scholarship about the relationship of rhetoric and law. Students will write a 15-20 page research paper that situates a legal case of global significance within a scholarly conversation about rhetorical theory. The paper will emerge from a series of short writing assignments totaling 70% of the grade, and the remaining 30% of the grade will consist of additional short writing assignments, reading responses, a presentation, and class participation."

Second, for students to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems. The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects. As a consequence, competency in both the C and Java programming languages is required."

This is followed by a discussion of the structural and thermodynamic aspects of the organization of these molecules into higher-order structures, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes. The kinetics and thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions are discussed for non-cooperative, cooperative, and allosteric binding events. The use of mechanistic and kinetic information in enzyme characterization and drug discovery are discussed. Topics pertinent to biotechnology include: antibody production and use, energy production in biochemical systems, expression of recombinant proteins, and methods of protein purification and characterization. The course is an alternate to 03231."

            "desc": "Literacy has been called the engine of economic development, the road to social advancement, and the prerequisite for critical abstract thought. But is it? And what should count as literacy: using the discourse of an educated elite or laying down a rap? Competing theories of what counts as \"literacy\" - and how to teach it - shape educational policy and workplace training. However, they may ignore some remarkable ways literacy is also used by people in non-elite communities to speak and act for themselves. In this introduction to the interdisciplinary study of literacy?its history, theory, and problems?we will first explore competing theories of what literacy allows you to do, how people learn to carry off different literate practices, and what schools should teach. Then we will turn ideas into action in a hands-on, community literacy project, helping urban students use writing to take literate action for themselves. As mentors, we meet on campus for 8 weeks with teenagers from Pittsburgh?s inner city neighborhoods who are working on the challenging transition from school to work. They earn the opportunity to come to CMU as part of Start On Success (SOS), an innovative internship that helps urban teenagers with hidden learning disabilities negotiate the new demands of work or college. We mentor them through Decision Makers (a CMU computer-supported learning project that uses writing as a tool for reflective decision making.) As your SOS Scholar creates a personal Decision Maker?s Journey Book and learns new strategies for writing, planning and decision making, you will see literacy in action and develop your own skills in intercultural collaboration and inquiry.

We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments.

Students will discover the relationship between formulating research questions considering a wide range of perspectives (e.g., political, ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects) and implementing the appropriate research methods for answering them. The course will emphasize interpretation and communication of analysis results in written and oral presentation, especially to non-technical audiences.

The course will emphasize the economic aspects of fiscal issues, but will also address their historical roots and political aspects. For example, its discussion of expenditure will address the constraints posed by the budget system and the political process on expenditure control. Similarly, it will explore how politics has shaped the tax system, and why the government policy discussion is so often stymied.

First 8 weeks of the course will include lectures and simulation-based homework assignments. During last 7 weeks, teams of students will work on self-proposed projects related to computational analysis of transport phenomena. In the project, students will learn to approach loosely defined problems through design of adequate computational mesh, choice of appropriate numerical scheme and boundary conditions, selection of suitable physical models, efficient utilization of available computational resources etc. Each team will communicate results of their project through multiple oral presentations and a final written report.

Many sustainability challenges are associated with commercial chemicals and with operational modes of the chemical enterprise. For scientists, effectiveness in solving the technical challenges and redirecting cultural behavior is the defining substance of sustainability leadership. The course aims to challenge students to analyze and understand the root causes of unsustainability, especially in the technological dimension, to imagine a more sustainable world and to begin to define personal leadership missions. Students will be introduced to sustainability ethics as the foundation stone of transformative sustainability leadership, to the Collins ?Sustainability Compass? and ?Code of Sustainability Ethics? and to the Rob\u00e9rt/Broman ?Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD)?as powerful guiding tools. The Collins ?Bookcase of Green Science Challenges? organizes the technical content. It systematizes the major chemical sustainability challenges of our time: clean synthesis, renewable feed-stocks, safe energy, elemental pollutants, persistent molecular toxicants and endocrine disruptors. Focal areas will be the technical, toxicological and cultural histories of elemental and molecular pollutants and endocrine disruptor (ED) science?EDs represent the single greatest sustainability challenge of everyday chemicals. The graded substance will take the form of take-home work. Students will primarily read key books and articles and will summarize and personally evaluate the material in essay assignments. The course is intended for upper level undergraduates and graduates. There are no other prerequisites. The class is limited to 25 students. The 09510 assignments are common to both undergraduate and graduate classes offerings. (Graduate course 12 units 09710) 3 hrs. lec."

(such as externalities, adverse selection, and natural monopoly) and potential remedies (such as taxes and fees, disclosure, price regulation, guarantees). The conflicting goals among regulators (and why we have multiple regulators) and their impact on the meaning of regulation will be considered along with regulatory competition/arbitrage. Portions of the course will tackle relatively broad questions such as: Why regulate? What is the law of unintended consequences? What is the objective of a policy advocate? Are regulators and regulatory policies a systemic risk? Are our markets rigged? How can regulators enhance the predictability and credibility of their policies? How costly were government guarantees during the financial crisis? Should we bar insider trading? Should regulations be determined and motivated based upon cost-benefit analysis? How can we evaluate the success or failure of particular regulations and whether they have achieved their objectives? How does the Dodd-Frank Act promote financial stability? What basic aspects of the financial crisis did Dodd-Frank not address? (Lecture, 3 hours). Minimum grade standard of \"C\" applies only to economics courses.

The spring semester of the third year of architectural studies at Carnegie Mellon University is concerned with the detailed development and refinement of an architectural design as informed by the technical knowledge of structural systems, enclosure systems and the process of construction. The student is expected to articulate concepts and develop designs with more precision and in greater detail than done in previous studios and courses. In addition to criteria related to the development of design skills appropriate to one's sixth semester of the studio sequence, the following criteria are an explicit part of the evaluation of the student work: Aesthetics: The degree to which the design responds to formal issues as articulated in prior design studios. Structural System: The degree to which the proposed building is presented as a statically stable structure which defines the spatial order and satisfies the architectural intentions made explicit in the project. Enclosure System: The degree to which the proposed enclosure system satisfies the design requirements and responds to the physical phenomena of the environment into which it is placed. Material Selection: The degree to which the selected building materials and their implementation are appropriate to the occupancy, articulate the architectural order, and satisfy the physical design requirements. Constructability: The degree to which the proposed building is developed in response to an understanding of the processes of construction. Presentation: The clarity, craft and completeness of the presentation."

According to critics, the use of drones by military and intelligence agencies is often unethical, that it is illegal to target individuals or small groups of people outside of formally declared war, and that there are hidden costs to drone warfare that are underreported in the mainstream media (including high civilian casualties, the intense psychosocial trauma inflicted upon communities that experience drone strikes, and the psychological impact on drone operators who witness the damage they cause through a computer monitor thousands of miles away).

Work is done in two-person teams, and \"team programming\" skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized. The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security. Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language. The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class. Auditing: this course is usually full, and we generally receive many more requests to audit than we can accept. If you wish to audit, please have your advisor contact us before the semester begins to discuss your educational goals."

We will use chemical principles including thermodynamics, kinetics, photochemistry, organic reaction mechanisms, and structure-activity relationships to understand the environmental fate of major classes of pollutants. The transport of chemicals through the environment and their partitioning between air, water, soil, and people will be described. The major environmental reaction pathways (oxidation, photolysis, hydrolysis, reduction, metabolism) of common pollutants will be explored. This will provide students with the necessary knowledge to predict the chemical fate of environmental pollutants, and improve their understanding of the environmental impacts of their everyday chemical use and exposure. Specific topics include water quality, photochemical smog, organic aerosols, atmospheric chemistry and global climate change, toxicity of pesticides, and heterogeneous and multiphase atmospheric chemistry.

The class will help guide you through the many stages of a research project: 1) selecting a meaningful question or problem that you wish to investigate; 2) reviewing existing scholarly writing on the topic in order to better articulate why your contribution is fresh and significant; 3) organizing and revising drafts of your paper; 4) designing and effectively delivering an oral presentation of your findings. As we help each other negotiate these steps, we will also consider issues related to what constitutes ?expertise? and why researchers may present competing evidence and conclusions. The class may include some guest speakers from and visits to some of the many research institutes in Washington. Course Website: http://www.cmu.edu/ir/washington-semester-program/"

Throughout the semester, students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers' expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels. Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers. Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. (All sections are offered MWF). Each 76100 course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English, but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings."

The course is open to seniors and graduate students in engineering, industrial and communication design, and MBA students. The course generally has about a dozen students from each discipline. The course consists of four modules including identifying, understanding, conceptualizing and introducing a product opportunity. In recent years we have partnered with industrial sponsors to address a customer opportunity, resulting in patent applications. The emphasis in the course is on the early, \"fuzzy\" stage of product development. The course gives structure to these stages and helps direct the process to be more efficient downstream. Students are expected to produce four phase written and oral reports. At the end of the semester the team will develop a form prototype, function prototype, marketing plan and manufacturing plan for the product.This course has gained an international reputation as a leading course in new product development. Course admission by permission of professor only; all students will be waitlisted until admission decisions are made. Students should contact the professor for an application for the course."

In this course, we will examine the way discourse is itself a form of social action that plays a fundamental role in organizing social, cultural, and political life. In addition to becoming familiar with a variety of approaches and topics in the study of discourse, a major aim of the course is for you to develop the tools and skills needed to analyze actual discourse data. This will involve learning how to read transcripts and transcribe data at different levels of detail, learning how to ask questions about the data based on different analytic interests, and developing a vocabulary of scholarly terms and concepts that will allow you to comment on discourse features as you formulate interesting and persuasive claims. The first part of the course will involve assignments with shared data to develop fundamental skills. In addition, seminar participants will be responsible for selecting pieces of discourse for mini data sessions throughout the semester. For the final assignment, you will choose and analyze a piece of spoken or written discourse of interest to you. In the end, you should come away from the course with an ability to think critically about the way discourse operates in the world."

Students will also learn how materials are processed and shaped (e.g., injection molding, casting, forging, extrusion, welding, grinding, and polishing), and will explore the origins of the properties, which vary by orders of magnitude. The course accomplishes the materials selection objective in part through example applications and in part through the use of CES EduPack software (a visual way to explore the world of materials and processes). Topics include: Materials selection by stiffness, weight, strength, fracture toughness, corrosion and oxidation, and thermal properties. Materials at high temperatures, materials shaping.

Students will study how market demand, tenant requirements, site constraints, zoning restrictions, and available capital affect design solutions. Course work includes classroom learning, independent reading and exercises, guest lectures, and examination of case studies. The semester?s effort culminates in the execution of a team development project based on a current Pittsburgh development project. Teams will complete a basic market analysis, program evaluation, schematic design creation, project cost estimation, pro forma analysis, and evaluation of financial feasibility. Development practitioners will provide a critique of each team?s project to offer ?real world? guidance on student schematic designs and feasibility analysis prior to the final completion of the project."

The course will trace the historical trajectories of these groups, both those dating back centuries, such as Mexican-Americans and certain Caribbean populations, and those with more recent, quickly growing populations, such as Salvadoran and Honduran immigrants, or \u00bfCentral-American Americans\u00bf, in an effort to understand how their identities are forged and transformed over time, considering both internal and external perspectives. Students will examine key moments in each group's history, drawing on materials from a variety of disciplines and sources including but not limited to film, literature, oral histories, newspapers articles, as well as theoretical articles that explore questions of identity, to compare and to contrast their diverse experiences. The course will include discussions and debates on the multiple factors that affect U.S. Latino populations, including for example, U.S. immigration policy, political and economic events in Latin America and the U.S. Further, we will consider the interplay of issues such as race, class, gender and sexuality, in the formation of U.S. Latino identities.

Major topics covered are computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, neuron behavior, and stochastic simulations. The imaging component includes basics of machine vision, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models. It includes homeworks requiring use or modification of Matlab scripts. Lectures and examinations are joint with 02252 but recitations are separate. Recitations for this course are intended primarily for biological sciences or biomedical engineering majors at the undergraduate or graduate level who have had little or no prior experience with computer science or programming. Students may not take both 03252/02252 and 03250/02250 for credit. Prerequisite: 03121 or permission of the instructor."

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs\u2014-that is, as a function. But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values. This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type. One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function. Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation. NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer Science course."

These psychological insights are particularly useful for marketing strategy, brand positioning, and marketing communication decisions, but also yield insight into common biases in judgment and decision making, beyond marketing, to which you would otherwise fall prey. Why people are willing to drive across town to save $5 on a tank of gasoline, for example, when they would not drive a minute to save $5 on a refrigerator. We will discuss some of these applications in class. In addition, we will examine the methodology of market research (specific to consumer behavior) to build the tools you will need to interpret and base decisions on it."

Technology plays an important role in shaping our worlds. At the same time, social forces often play a central role in the evolution of a technology. A particular technology such as an automobile or computer is chosen to study technology and policy in context. Specific topics covered in the case of the automobile includes automotive design and manufacture, safety, pollution, fuel economy and their interactions. In each area, we discuss the technological and institutional issues, their interaction, the possible need for public policy and the factors that govern the policy. The course will involve several group problem-solving sessions."

One such option is conducting undergraduate research with a faculty member. Students do not need to officially register for undergraduate research unless they want it listed on their official transcripts. An ECE student who is involved in a research project and is interested in registering this undergraduate research for course credit on the official transcript may request to be enrolled in this course. To do this, the student should first complete the on-line undergraduate research form available on the ECE undergraduate student page. Once the form has been submitted and approved by the faculty member the student is conducting the research with, the ECE Undergraduate Office will add the course to the student's schedule. Typical credit is granted as one hour of research per week is equal to one unit of credit."

The demands of professional training force many of us to skimp on our understanding of major artistic achievements. So, this class is for those people who should have read some of the best books around, but haven't managed to yet - books you should have read by now. Kurt Vonnegut's character Kilgore Trout sings the praises of Dostoevski's The Brothers Karamazov, (and the same thing might be said about Crime and Punishment) pointing out that it contains everything you need to know about life. He then ruefully adds that unfortunately that?s not enough anymore. It may not be enough, but it might be a place to start. Each book will be considered in itself for whatever it might offer by way of understanding the world, the past, the present, ourselves and others. Finally we shall use the idea that literature is equipment for living as a way of understanding and evaluating our experiences. Or: what use is it to have read some of the so-called \"great books\" of the Western canon? A recurrent interest will be in improving our language ability in general as we consider various books of central importance to our cultural traditions.

            "desc": "Would coming to CMU and not studying Shakespeare seem like going to the Sistine Chapel and not looking up? In 1878, Andrew Carnegie left his growing steel empire to sail around the world. Content to leave his business, he was not content to leave his 13-volume set of Shakespeare's complete works. He later wrote: \"I have read carefully eleven of Shakespeare's plays during the spare hours of the voyage...They are such gems. I...feel as if I have made new friends, whose angel visits will do me good in days and nights to come?..everything has its 'environment,' and Shakespeare is the environment of all English-speaking men.\" Much has changed since Carnegie wrote those words, but many still hunger for an introduction to Shakespeare's Tragedies and Histories like this one. Our reading list will include hauntingly powerful plays such as Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, King Lear, Henry V, Richard II, 1 Henry IV, and Henry V. Students at the end of the course should expect to have a good grounding in the language, themes, and characters of Shakespearean Tragedies and Histories and perhaps more importantly be equipped to think carefully about Shakespeare's plays in relation to poetics, topical politics, and genre. In addition to regular short writing exercises of varying types, assignments will include one close reading paper, a longer research paper, and performance of a scene."

We will then move into case studies and theoretical works exploring the intersections of language use, individual and group identities, and the exercise of power, in its many forms. In particular, we will focus on the relationship between language and culture by asking, in what ways does language influence and constitute social change? How is social change reflected by changes in the way we use language? Over the course of the semester, you will work on applying the knowledge and theoretical tools you gain to your own analysis of a linguistic artifact that you choose."

New technologies-including online gaming, interactive film, \"social\" media, podcasts and smartphone apps-have enormous potential to change the way people learn. Especially intriguing is their potential to promote active, exploratory learning. We have only scratched the surface of this potential. Imagine interactive technologies that impart a deep understanding of the human condition. Imagine the compelling motivational strategies of well-designed games used to spark inquiry and scientific curiosity. Imagine immersive experiences that deepen our capacity for critical thinking, empathy or compassion. What if we applied absorbing interactive media to the task of delivering a first-rate humane education? In this course, we will explore a topic of elemental human concern (e.g. inequality, abortion and human reproduction, the nature of the social contract, the separation of church and state, population and sustainability?) and develop a deep, interdisciplinary understanding of the issue. Then, instead of producing a term paper, we'll collaborate with a team from CMU's Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) to design and prototype a next-generation learning tool that brings the issue to life. The result will push the boundaries of what is possible in the way of technologically mediated learning."

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic models in scientific investigation. Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation into frequency-based components. In the visual system, V1 simple cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized using dynamic place models. It has also been proposed that perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian) combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers. Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise'' components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function. This course will examine some of the most important methods and claims that have come from applying statistical thinking"

Learning hand craft techniques, developing hand skills and the sensitivity to materials are also a goal. Binding projects assigned will target the unique nature of papers, fabrics and archival card-boards. Structural procedures and techniques will be identified with each assigned binding project. The binding projects will be: A hardcover for a paper back book, a single signature book, a multi-signature book with flat spine, and a box construction. The box project is designed and crafted to contain a small letterpress printed class edition, either in book form, or as a set of un-bound pages. The letterpress component teaches the standard issues, unique to the relief process, in press work, handset procedure of cast metal type, page form spacing, lock-up of pages in press, proofing, and production printing. Each semester a small class edition project of text content and image, in two-color registration, is designed, hand set and printed. Image generation can be by hand cut block, assembled type-high forms, or digital process to polymer plate. This class is not to be repeated."

This course takes a less conventional rhetorical approach to public policy which focuses attention on the values, beliefs, and argument structures associated with issues as a method of assessing them and as a means for moving forward with effective strategy for their resolution. Towards this end, we will be studying the theories and analytic methods of both classical and modern rhetorical scholarship as well as modern public policy theory.

Students will choose one form or the other by end of the first week. Both television and film writing employ many of the same techniques and present many of the same problems. By teaching both forms together we believe writers will gain from each perspective. Assignments for TV writers include analysis of the chosen show, creation of show breakdowns, scene studies, and beat sheets. Screenwriters will work on creating a usable premise, dimensional characters, a detailed act structure, and a step outline. Lectures include fundamentals of dramatic structure, dialogue, and script format. Both groups will produce an interim and final draft; both will have their work critiqued in class. The final project for students who choose TV writing is a \"spec script\" for a one-hour drama, broadcast in the US any time during the last 30 years. Image-driven screenwriters will produce by semester's end an original 60-minute screenplay."

The second part of the course considers the history of skepticism about empirical knowledge, covering Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Descartes, Pascal, and Hume, along with replies to skepticism in the works of Bayes and Kant. The third part of the course discusses theories of the nature of mind, culminating in the computational conception of mind that underlies contemporary cognitive science."

            "desc": "Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles ?Teenie? Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences. In Spring 2015, students will be expected to make one or more visits to Carnegie Museum of Art to view Storyteller: The Photographs of Duane Michals, an internationally recognized living photographer who is being celebrated this year with this retrospective exhibition."

Fueled by the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, many Europeans saw conspiracies behind every door and spies in every corner. Some of these conspiracies and spies were real, some less so. Using contemporary sources (including newspaper reports, letters, military dispatches and diaries), we will examine the social and political impact of these conspiracies, and the insurgents, spies and assassins who carried out their agendas."

This course aims to introduce the main ideas at a high level of rigour and generality. The course starts with the study of (potentially) infinite-dimensional vector spaces over an arbitrary field, continues with the theory of modules (where the role of the field is now played by an arbitrary ring), and concludes with the development of real and complex inner product spaces. Topics to be covered include: Review of fields. Review of Zorn's Lemma. Vector spaces (possibly in finite dimensional) over an arbitrary field. Independent sets, bases, existence of a basis, exchange lemma, dimension. Linear transformations, dual space. Multilinear maps, tensor product, exterior power, determinant of a transformation. Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, characteristic and minimal polynomial of a transformation, Cayley-Hamilton theorem. Review of commutative rings. R-modules. Sums and quotients of modules. Free modules. Structure theorem for fg modules over a PID and applications (Jordan and rational canonical form, structure theory of fg abelian groups). Review of real and complex numbers. Real and complex inner product spaces. Orthonormal sets, orthonormal bases, Gram-Schmidt. Examples: F^n and l^2(F) for F = R; C. Operators: Symmetric/Hermitian and Orthogonal/Unitary operators. Spectral theorem. Quadratic forms. Singular value decomposition. Possible additional topics (time permitting): applications to combinatorics, category theory, representations of finite groups, normed spaces. 3 hrs. lec."

In this class structure students will be able to plan and design projects that are complete books, with printed content, or with out content. Other flat structures, and three dimensional containers are examples of general forms that will be categorized as binding work. Students who wish to enroll in this course must have already taken Beginning Book Arts, and must also speak to the instructor directly about project ideas. Emphasis for binding is working independently with a greater level of hand craft and a sensitivity to materials. Emphasis for letterpress printing is to learn in depth, and master, the general mechanical process for doing press work. Emphasis for hand typesetting is on gaining an understanding of the system of cast metal type, and to develop a sensitivity to typographic principles. Instruction will be given on an individual basis through consultation at strategic times throughout the semester. Project evaluation will be based on the success of the project work compared to each student's written project proposal at the start of the semester. The Advanced Workshop in Book Arts can be repeated. For more complex project work this class can be continued for the following semester."

Students will work in teams on an innovative project that will involve the hands-on design, configuration, engineering, implementation and testing of a prototype of an embedded system of their choice. Students will be expected to leverage proficiency and background gained from other courses, particularly with regard to embedded real-time principles and embedded programming. The project will utilize a synergistic mixture of skills in system architecture, modular system design, software engineering, subsystem integration, debugging and testing. From inception to demonstration of the prototype, the course will follow industrial project practices, such as version control, design requirements, design reviews and quality assurance plans. The initial lecture content will cover background material intended to complement the project work. The remainder of the course will consist of regular team presentations of key project milestones, current project status, a final project presentation and functional demonstrations of various subsystems, even as the entire prototype is being developed.

We will then move into case studies and theoretical works exploring the intersections of language use, individual and group identities, and the exercise of power, in its many forms. In particular, we will focus on the relationship between language and culture by asking, in what ways does language influence and constitute social change? How is social change reflected by changes in the way we use language? Over the course of the semester, you will work on applying the knowledge and theoretical tools you gain to your own analysis of a linguistic artifact that you choose.

Applications such as optical communication, tissue and bone replacement, fuel cells, and information storage, to name a few, exemplify areas where new materials are required to realize many of the envisioned future technologies. This course provides an introduction to how science and engineering can be exploited to design materials for many applications. The principles behind the design and exploitation of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites are presented using examples from everyday life, as well as from existing, new, and future technologies.

In this course, we'll try to understand how that works, given that we cannot in fact take our thoughts out of our heads and show them to someone else. We'll explore different views on the relationship between thought and meaning, and different views about how language succeeds in communicating thoughts and ideas. We'll explore the idea of a language of thought, and ask whether the language we speak influences our thought. At the same time, we will want to understand how it is that language hooks up to the world, enabling us to talk not only about what we think, but also about the way things actually are. We'll look at the role of inference in language understanding, and at the nature of non-literal communication, in particular metaphor. The course will be based on readings drawn from philosophy, linguistics and psychology. Students in the course should be prepared for extensive reading, writing and peer discussion assignments."

It addresses the question: How can one analyze the structure of rational discourse or, more specifically, the logical structure of argumentation? An answer to this question requires: (i) uncovering the logical form of statements; (ii) defining the correctness of logical steps; (iii) formulating inference rules for the logical forms; (iv) designing strategies for argumentation with the inference rules. The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic. Presentation: The material is presented on-line, though some exercises must be done with pen and paper. Additional reading of historical and philosophical character complements the systematic on-line presentation. Weekly small discussion meetings with collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections supplement the on-line material."

The rich vestiges of the mythical past of this region were then brought to the light, in the frame of complex and adventurous missions. The eyes of scholars, travelers and artists filtered and transformed the reality of the ancient objects and places, adding to their fascination and vitality and changing the way we perceive this legacy today. At the same time though, a new political agenda, new biases and new aims were connected with the rediscovery. These in turn influenced not only the way the past of the region was explored and the way the finds were studied and exposed, but also the cultural debate in the rest of Europe, with important effects on the architecture of the main European cities."

We will explore the ideal of Christian marriage and family and examine how the \"ideal\" compared to the reality on such issues as marriage practices, family, gender roles, and sexuality. We will also explore the fashioning of female and masculine gender norms and the construction of the male and female sense of self over time. In the process, we will examine the larger historiographical issue of the use of gender as a tool of historical analysis."

Many sustainability challenges are associated with commercial chemicals and with operational modes of the chemical enterprise. For scientists, effectiveness in solving the technical challenges and redirecting cultural behavior is the defining substance of sustainability leadership. The course aims to challenge students to analyze and understand the root causes of unsustainability, especially in the technological dimension, to imagine a more sustainable world and to begin to define personal leadership missions. Students will be introduced to sustainability ethics as the foundation stone of transformative sustainability leadership, to the Collins ?Sustainability Compass? and ?Code of Sustainability Ethics? and to the Rob\u00e9rt/Broman ?Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD)?as powerful guiding tools. The Collins ?Bookcase of Green Science Challenges? organizes the technical content. It systematizes the major chemical sustainability challenges of our time: clean synthesis, renewable feed-stocks, safe energy, elemental pollutants, persistent molecular toxicants and endocrine disruptors. Focal areas will be the technical, toxicological and cultural histories of elemental and molecular pollutants and endocrine disruptor (ED) science?EDs represent the single greatest sustainability challenge of everyday chemicals. The graded substance will take the form of take-home work. Students will primarily read key books and articles and will summarize and personally evaluate the material in essay assignments. The course is intended for upper level undergraduates and graduates. There are no other prerequisites. The class is limited to 25 students. The 09510 assignments are common to both undergraduate and graduate classes offerings and 09710 students will engage in additional projects. 3 hrs. lec."

Possible, in principle, but beyond our current technology. Impossible by any science we know. Topics to be covered include the future of the technological society, the physics of Star Trek, the nature of space and time, extraterrestrial intelligence, robotics and artificial intelligence, biotechnology and more. Success of this course will depend upon class participation. Students will be expected to contribute to discussion of assigned readings and problems, and to give brief presentations in class on assigned films."

Emphasis will be placed on the biomechanics of edible matter across multiple length scales, including at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels; additionally, impact on global health and engineering implications will be elucidated. During this course, we will introduce you to these concepts,train you to use them in real world applications, and allow you to pursue a creative group-defined project, which will be shared in both written and oral formats. We will integrate a hands-on kitchen experience in at least 3 specific laboratory classes so that students will get a true feel and understanding for culinary mechanics. We also will be visiting the restaurant of at least one first-rate Pittsburgh chef to gain real world insight into mechanics and cooking. Course Website: http://www.cmu.edu/me/"

How have outside influences and other languages impacted the French language, and how has French influenced other languages? How do language policies affect the form and use of French in different regions of the world? Through readings, videos, homework, class discussions, and hands-on activities, students will gain an understanding of the various subdisciplines of the field of sociolinguistics in general and of French sociolinguistics in particular.

This course focuses on the scientific problem of analyzing causal hypotheses in real-world settings, not on the mathematical details of regression. After clearly distinguishing prediction from causation, we discuss how to represent causal hypotheses and how to use regressions to analyze both predictive and causal hypotheses. Using in-class data exercises throughout, we will examine how to move from an interesting but somewhat vague question about the world (e.g., do police discriminate based on race and gender, do NFL athletes choke under high pressure, does parenthood improve happiness) to a clear statistical model that, when estimated, meaningfully addresses the question asked. The course emphasizes causal analysis as the main research goal and multivariate linear regression as the main statistical tool. After mastering basic techniques, we will introduce students to more advanced econometric approaches such as panel regressions and instrumental variables to deal with trickier settings in which causal inference is more challenging (e.g., do more guns lead to more violence?). In keeping with the hands-on philosophy of the course, a central focus of the semester will be a group research paper/presentation where students will have the opportunity to formulate and empirically test a research question of their choosing. Students will learn how to find, clean, and analyze a new dataset, and then concisely communicate their findings in the form of a scientific paper (and accompanying presentation). The research project makes this course excellent preparation for any student who hopes to ultimately write an undergraduate thesis."

Preferential enrollment will be given to graduate students and undergraduate students who have demonstrated a need for this technique in their research. The class will include one hour of lecture and 4 hours of laboratory each week (some additional laboratory time outside of the scheduled laboratory time is required). Students will learn basic methods in specimen preparation for both transmission and scanning electron microscopy (fixation, embedding and ultramicrotomy, drying and metal coating) and will be trained in the operation of both the Hitachi 7100 and 2460N electron microscopes. Lectures and laboratories during the last few weeks of the semester will introduce the students to special techniques (e.g. immunoelectron microscopy , cryoultramicrotomy, freeze substitution, variable pressure SEM, etc.) and will allow them to work with samples from their own research. Experimentation using living organisms and/or their tissues, cells or molecules is an essential component of this course. Special permission is required."

This thematic research seminar will explore the workings of Congress - the first branch under the Constitution - and its role in making public policy. It combines coursework with the original scholarship requirements of a UCDC research seminar and is designed particularly for students in Congressional internships and those considering Congressional staff positions after graduation. This seminar will take advantage of our Washington location by featuring frequent guest speakers and seeking connections to current policy and political debate. In addition to studying the pathways of lawmaking, we will ask how Congress and its Members relate to the other branches of government, the press, and the public. Topics to be examined include the rules and organization of Capitol Hill, campaign finance, redistricting, lawmaking and the House and Senate rules, budget process and politics, executive oversight, judicial nominations, lobbyists and influence, and policy entrepreneurialism. Seminar requirements in addition to the internship include preparation and in-class participation, a substantial research brief and several applied writing assignments related to a policy that currently is or should be before Congress.

Students will learn how to conduct research on scientific topics using primary and secondary sources, how to conduct interviews, and how to organize that information in a logical fashion for presentation. For writing majors, the course will increase their understanding of scientific research and how to describe it accurately and completely to a general audience. For science majors, this course will teach them how to craft fluid, powerful prose so that they can bring their disciplines to life. The course is not intended just for those who want to become science journalists, but for anyone who may have the need to explain technical information to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearing, a doctor describing the latest research on a disease to a patient advocacy group, or a computer programmer describing new software to his firm's marketing staff. Students will get a chance to read several examples of top-notch science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles - and rewriting them after they've been edited. The articles will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works to explorations of controversies in science. Students should expect to see their writing critiqued in class from time to time, in a process similar to what journalists routinely go through. The goal will be clarity and verve; the ethos will be mutual learning and enjoyment. Course Website: http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/index.html"

The Jazz Ensembles are carefully coordinated with the Jazz Performance Minor program, the Jazz Vocal Ensemble, and other major ensembles in order to challenge and prepare students for professional music career opportunities. Both ensembles perform on the regular School of Music concert series (2-3 shows per semester) and for on-campus events. Trips to festivals and performances at local venues as part of jazz concert series also occur. The \"final exam\" for this course is a performance at a local jazz club. Admission of undergraduate and graduate students is by competitive audition and placement is by the director. Grading is based on attendance, preparation, and consistent progress."

            "desc": "Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles \"Teenie\" Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences. In Spring 2015, students will be expected to make one or more visits to Carnegie Museum of Art to view Storyteller: The Photographs of Duane Michals, an internationally recognized living photographer who is being celebrated this year with this retrospective exhibition."

The course unfolds along two parallel trajectories: research (literature review, lectures, readings, demonstrations) and design (three iterated individualized projects and a fourth larger scale final project). The first half of the course will introduce students to a wide range of theories and techniques within urban intervention that draw from fluxus, the situationist international, activism and hacktivism, as well as public policy, philosophy, psychology and economics. Students will study theoretical and practical frameworks for artistic intervention into public urban spaces, while concurrently researching actual sites and communities within Pittsburgh for experimentation. Students are required to conceptualized projects on larger (urban) scales, and find ways to implement their projects safely and legally by pursuing the necessary administrative, social, technical, financial steps required to create meaningful interventions in public spaces. This class will specifically explore three media for urban intervention: Sound Outdoor video projection Robotics, Autonomy and Mobility in the way of remote control vehicles (e.g. cars, quad-copters, etc.). For each theme, students are required to produce one project that is iterated twice or more. The undergraduate (60441) and graduate (60741) sections of the course meet concurrently and follow the same syllabus and assignments. In addition to the coursework documented in the syllabus, Graduate level students are expected to write a research paper suitable for submission to a notable relevant academic conference. This process includes a rough draft, revisions and a completed and formatted paper ready for submission."

The first half of the course will be theoretical, covering nucleation, growth, instability, solidification microstructure: cells, dendrites, eutectic and peritectic structures, solute redistribution, inclusion formation and separation, defects and heat transfer problems. The second part of the course will be process oriented and will include conventional and near net shape casting, investment casting, rapid solidification and spray casting where the emphasis will be on process design to avoid defects."

The 20s, like the 50s and 60s, were marked by the effects of World War. Gertrude Stein seems to have started the whole generation naming fad with her comment to Hemingway, \"You are the lost generation.\" Paul Fussell identifies the cultural effect of WWI as the production of 'irony' as the central quality of modern identity (Some Beat writers make a similar claim for the effects of WWII). This class is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Beat writers class; it is related in theme but focused on different writers and texts. Students might consider taking this class as a point of entry to 'The Beat,' or might consider this class as a follow-on to 'The Beat' in order to understand more fully some of the central literary and historical issues of our time. In both cases we focus on the intersection between cultural change and major war. The Lost Generation class might include, for example, work by Stein, Hemingway, W.B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, the major War Poets, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert Graves, Vera Brittain, and Evelyn Waugh."

The project can be either a scholarly or creative endeavor, and may take one of many possible forms (e.g., a written thesis, a compilation of creative work or works, an experiment and report, a computer program or animation, etc.). The BXA Capstone sequence covers both semesters of a student's senior year. In the fall, students are enrolled in 52401 BXA Seminar IV: Capstone Fall (9 units), which meets weekly to discuss strategies for managing research, planning the project, and larger theoretical issues related to interdisciplinary work. At the end of the fall course, students will have produced a Capstone Project proposal, an annotated bibliography, and multiple versions of their project pitch. In the spring, students enroll in 52402 BXA Seminar: Capstone Spring (9 units), which has no required classroom time. Instead, students spend the semester doing the research and foundational work necessary for the project, as well as meeting with their faculty and BXA advisors as they create their Capstone Project and prepare to present it at the annual Meeting of the Minds Undergraduate Research Symposium held each May. Students will only be enrolled in 52400 (9 units) when they are unable to complete a two-semester sequence and need to gain special permission by the BXA Director/Academic Advisor."

Typical assignments include resumes, instructions, proposals, and adaptations of specialized information for non-expert audiences. At least one of the assignments will be a group project. As a final project, you?ll create a portfolio of polished writing samples that you can use in applying for internships and employment. The range of assignments in the course is designed to give you experience with a variety of writing situations that professional writers frequently encounter. The assignments also reflect options for specialization that you may wish to pursue in future coursework and in your career as a professional writer. As you work through the assignments, you should learn both current conventions for the kinds of writing you?ll be doing and a broadly applicable procedure for analyzing novel situations and adapting conventional forms (and creating new ones) to meet the unique demands of each new situation and task.

Issue surrounding natural forms such as behavior, locomotion, adaptation, the environment and systems will also be investigated. We will work in tandem on refining our abilities in communicating what we discover through the process of drawing. A variety of visualization methods will be covered i.e. analytical drawing, visual notes, and diagramming to name a few. We will be using a variety of basic drawing and digital media to develop our work as we uncover aspects of form, structure and surface. Guest speakers will present work they have done in areas such as botany, biology, and environmental studies to name a few. A majority of the work will be done in the field and will then be developed in the studio. A final project will be assigned that will challenge you to develop a concept along with a compelling form(s) that communicates what you have uncovered about nature to a variety of audiences. This course builds on your experiences from First Year drawing and introduces several more advanced visualization methods. This course is intended for Junior and Senior Design Majors."

The function, use, and harmonious sequencing of letterforms is taught through weekly projects. Awareness of rhythm, texture and letterform structure is achieved through routine exercises. Drills, demonstrations, discussions, individual and class critiques are on-going. Additional related topics and activities introduced in class include books: binding and design. A brief introduction to the historical development of our Western alphabet is provided through film, slides, demonstrations, with discussion of twentieth-century type designs. Students also gain exposure to letter vocabulary, paleography, monoprints, words and punctuation, classical page design, publication design-past and present, and calligraphy's role in design today. Thinking with hands and eyes, the manual placement and spacing of letters practiced in this course awakens sensitivity and judgment in the designer."

In lectures, class discussion, and student projects, we will explore the topic of building performance, the design and technical strategies that support sustainable high performance; the design, construction and operation processes that are likely to produce sustainable high(er) performance buildings; and the current state of theory versus practice. The course assumes a basic understanding of buildings' impact on the environment, of building design and materials performance, and the calculation of building heating and cooling loads. On that foundation, we will examine the concept of systems integration and how this approach can sustain the occupants and the environment far better than conventional design, construction and operation. Although US climate, building conventions and codes will be our reference point, we will broaden our discussion by using examples and data from many other countries. An essential aspect of our exploration will be identifying successful built projects and examining the factors that may have allowed those projects to succeed. If this course meets its objectives, students who successfully complete the material will understand and be able to discuss sustainable building performance characteristics, will understand the systems integration approach and how it differs from conventional approaches to building design, and will know how to positively affect architectural and engineering decisions to support the design, construction and operation of sustainable high performance buildings."

Students may begin with any one of the three courses at this level or they may be taken concurrently. FALL 2015: This course will explore Latin American culture and language, focusing on issues of cultural identity. Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity, six periods will be identified as they are organized around crisis when the topic of \u00bfWho we are? becomes a central debate (Larra\u00edn 1996). These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the interwar period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships, and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and certain controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larra\u00edn 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. Three main questions will be discussed throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?, How does Latin America think of itself?, What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films, and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies."

This course will help you understand the unique economic characteristics seen in today's technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. We will study, for example: Why firms in the IT industry give away their best products for free. Why makers of video gaming consoles subsidize end users (but tax game developers) while computer operating system makers subsidize software developers (but overcharge end users). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies. In order to understand how firms strategically interact with consumers in technology-intensive industries this course will use a combination of simple but rigorous analytical models, emerging theories, and formal case studies."

Directors, designers, actors, and dramaturgs work in groups to generate original ideas, images, texts, and material in a workshop environment. These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations. The emphasis is on process, not product \u2014 devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development \u2014 both of which are explored here. We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included: Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more. Students learn to define and distinguish these artist's approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion. This class is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline. We focus on the process of creating a theatrical language which truly integrates disciplines."

Students will attend at least one live literary event to experience poetry as performance, as well as visit a museum or gallery to use the visual or plastic arts as a springboard for their poetry. Finally, students will acquire and hone the vocabulary necessary to offer constructive feedback on one another?s work."

In the human-computer interaction community there are many examples of interaction-styles that offer a more physical/tangible experience. In order to design products that offer such experiences new skills and tools are necessary: not only do we need to explore aspects of expressive form and interaction; we also need to explore expressive (physical) product behavior with an emphasis on sensing and actuating. While there are tools such as arduino, phidgets or gadgeteer available to do this there is little integration with the simultaneous exploration of form. This course aims to offer this integration. This course is open to Industrial Design juniors, seniors and grads ? others by permission of the instructor. Cardboard Modeling I is a prerequisite, unless approved by the instructor.

Pricing by replication is then considered in a one-period random model. Risk-neutral probability measures, the Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing, and an introduction to expected utility maximization and mean-variance analysis are presented in this model. Finally, replication is studied in a multi-period binomial model. Within this model, the replicating strategies for European and American options are determined. 3 hrs. lec."

The course will serve as an extended case-study for the application of concepts and analytical strategies taught in basic linguistics courses to some of these languages. Specifically, we take a bottom-up approach to Dutch, Frisian, Icelandic, and Danish, starting with raw language material whenever possible, which we progressively analyze in terms of phonetics and phonology, morphology, and syntax. These case studies lead to comparisons between the languages and insight into their development and divergence over time. We follow this hands-on approach with historical and grammatical overviews, touching on some of the outstanding issues in Germanic linguistics. The approach should also help bring out the relevance of diachronic factors in the synchronic study of language, with historical forms of English being open to investigation, as these often reflect patterns found in contemporary Germanic languages."

It is intended for women only because it is believed that the presence of males in class (other than instructors or other authorized persons) can alter the emotional and physical responses of women to class material and thereby hinder their ability to reach course objectives. It is of the utmost importance that women be able to maximize their opportunity to learn in the company of like-minded students. The core of the course is based upon the principles of the Rape Aggression Defense System (R.A.D.)which was conceived and developed by Larry N. Nadeau. His goal in developing R.A.D. is also its motto: \"To develop and enhance the options of self-defense, so they may become viable considerations to the woman who is attacked.\" This course is composed of three sections: risk reduction principles, physical defense techniques, and simulation. Risk reduction principles include a thorough review of personal self-awareness & the environment, whether in the home, neighborhood, or unfamiliar community. Physical defense techniques include the introduction to bodily strikes with hands, kicks with the feet, and defenses against grabs & holds. Simulation is the activity that attempts to incorporate, via physical demonstration, all emotional & physical techniques that have been taught through the acting out of scenarios involving instructors (padded/protected) as attackers, and students (padded/protected) responding to the assault."

A series of assignments will help students move from general interests in vast topics, to charting a focused, rigorous research process that builds on existing knowledge and attempts to develop new ideas and advances the discipline. Students will begin to identify precedents, key readings and a research bibliography, an overview of the general topic they will research in depth, a detailed plan for a year?s worth of independent thesis work, and a well-defined end-product, likely a design proposal. An important task will be to identify advisors who can support, guide, and critique your work, who can act as intellectual collaborators as much as evaluators. The primary deliverable is a substantial proposal for a year-long Thesis or a one-semester ?Independent Project.? This course (or an equivalent approved by the Thesis coordinator) is a pre-requisite for doing a year-long ?Thesis? or semester-long ?Independent Project? in 5th year studio."

Students will study its enabling technologies, building blocks, and gain hands-on experience through projects utilizing public cloud infrastructures. Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains. The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the cloud\u00bfs motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models. Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources. Students will develop and evaluate scaling and load balancing solutions, work with cloud storage systems, and develop applications in several programming paradigms. 15619 students must complete an extra team project which entails designing and implementing a cost- and performance-sensitive web-service for querying big data."

Since the focus of energy conversion methods studied in this course is from electrical to mechanical systems, special attention is paid to electromagnetic theory. Rotating machines theory is developed and intuitively explained starting with Maxwell equations and analyzing general static and dynamic electromagnetic circuits. Power electronics methods are also introduced because most of modern electrical systems employ such methods. At this point, the necessary background is gained to analyze real life electrical energy conversion systems. We will focus on automotive, airplane, space station, and sea power systems. The main focus will be on operational principles and when appropriate stability issues of particular implementations. Time allowing, dynamic problems with interconnecting such systems will be briefly introduced and possibly studied by curious students in their course projects."

Illustrative examples will be drawn from the area of semiconductor nanostructures, including their applications in novel and next-generation electronic, photonic, and sensing devices. The course begins with a review of basic concepts in quantum physics (wave-particle duality, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, particle-in-a-box, approximation methods in quantum mechanics, etc.) and then continues with a discussion of bulk three-dimensional solids (band structure, density of states, the single-electron effective-mass approximation). Size effects due to nanometer-scale spatial localization are then discussed within a quantum-confinement model in one-, two-, and three- dimensions for electrons. An analogous discussion for photons is also presented. The basic electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of the low-dimensional nanostructures are then discussed. A select number of applications in electronics, photonics, biology, chemistry, and bio-engineering will be discussed to illustrate the range of utility of nanostructures. Upon completion of the course, students will have an appreciation and an understanding of some of the fundamental concepts in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The course is suitable for first-year graduate students in engineering and science (but advanced undergraduates with appropriate backgrounds may also take it with permission from the instructor). Pre-requisites include 09511, 09701, 09702, 18311, 27770, 33225, 33234 or familiarity with the material or basic concepts covered in these courses."

Thesis topics and research agendas are generated by the student, but must be determined in collaboration with an advising team, and approved by a Thesis Coordinator. The School seeks to encourage an expansive range of rigorous and provocative inquiry as a culminating experience for the B.Arch education, including work that speculates, invents, or improves on existing ideas, practices, or systems through research and design; work that challenges the boundaries of the discipline and the profession, and moves beyond mere practice or solution-based work; worj that engages with open-ended and generalizable ideas, as much as with specific situations; work that projects or imagines a better future and an improved world; work that leads to the new knowledge, ideas, understanding, or paradigms. Acceptance into Thesis is dependent on passing the 48497 ?Thesis Prep? course or its pre-approved equivalent, and submitting a rigorous thesis proposal to the Thesis Coordinator in late August, before the begin of classes."

It will take an anthropological approach, focusing on humans as extraordinary culture-makers, whose definition is inseparably tied to making Art and Symbolic-Objects. The approaches to study and research will utilize multi-media and explore the History of the Arts in multidisciplinary ways - across Time and Space. It will start with a somewhat linear approach towards cultural artifacts and remains, surveying them from the earliest periods down towards our own Common Era. It will also take a multi-cultural perspective relating and comparing cultures across different parts of our world. The methodologies will include investigating ?Time-Capsules? which will focus on interrelated groupings of related cultural materials organized as ? People, Places, Objects, Events and Ideas. The intention is to create a meaningful ?Matrix? which brings together the most significant examples of Art, Architecture, Design, Music and Drama. The setting of the Carnegie Museums will be used as a creative-context for interacting with potent symbolic examples of Human-creativity in ways that transcend what is normally experienced in printed words and pictures. There will also be the creation and development of an ?I-Story? by the participants. Each student?s I-story will be a form of a personal journal (but including multimedia) relating their own individual historical research experiences ? to the larger and more universal sequences (cycles) and archetypes of the World of Arts Histories. These creative narratives can evolve into and become important direct connections between the great cycles of Human History and the adventure of Evolution - and the individual student's own narrative and story of growth and development in the present day World of education and learning."

Applying core theoretical work (that originated from Carnegie Mellon) and current empirical results from academic studies, students will first formulate an investment plan for the regional markets. Working in small teams, students will investigate the applicability of the plan to their subset of stocks as well as apply standard valuation theory. Team results will then be pooled and screened to identify the final set of stocks from which the portfolio will be constructed. This final set of stocks is then used by students to apply the underlying principles of portfolio design including the use of risk management constraints. This part of the course will use Excel?s Solver, a flexible constrained optimization tool that students should master. Students will also learn how common metrics (including Value-at Risk), are used to plan and evaluate portfolio performance. The course will culminate with a formal presentation of the investment plan to an advisory board consisting of faculty members (and other relevant members)."

Students will begin by describing and classifying the historical drivers for innovation in water treatment, including technical, economic, and regulatory drivers. After an introduction to the fundamental principles of water treatment technologies, students will identify present day technology shortcomings and distill these into discrete design objectives. Students will then formulate and answer quantitative and qualitative questions that respond to these design objectives by leveraging their knowledge of engineering fundamentals, regulatory tools, and pricing policies. Comparing their own solutions with those proposed in the peer-reviewed academic literature in engineering and the social sciences, students will evaluate the technical feasibility, usability, and social desirability of proposed water innovations in developed and developing countries and summarize their findings in policy briefs."

This course will thus focus more on concepts and foundations, rather than technical aspects of learning, whether mathematical, experimental, or computational. This course will be almost entirely project-based: you will work in groups (with students from different backgrounds) to identify opportunities for learning media, and then develop designs that appropriately address those opportunities. In the course of developing these media designs, you will learn, and come to understand, concepts and principles of learning from different disciplines. The emphasis throughout will be on careful conceptualization, description, and design of the learning through and about media."

Over the years, this course has canvassed the Washington theater scene and discovered a wealth of politically and socially attuned material on DC stages. Washington has, rather surprisingly, emerged as the second most vibrant theatrical city in the nation, surpassing Chicago and Los Angeles in number of performances offered, audience in attendance, and union actors appearing in Equity-contracted productions. The city now boasts some of the finest classical flagship and culturally specific theaters in the country. This advent of a robust theater scene planted in the seat of power has created a unique cultural profile; that of an artistic force able to speak truth to power. Yet oftentimes, theatrical institutions are constricted by the divided nature of the audience they play for, or the critical community that critiques them, or differing notions about the purpose of theater. What kind of portraits are emerging from area theaters in this politicized capital? What are the practical politics within these institutions that seek to engage and entertain their patrons? In addition to introducing students of the wonders of consistent theater-going with dynamic post-performance discussions with the artists who make the art, our focus will concern politically oriented works.

The elementary school experience will involve regular visits, mentoring, and tutoring at school sites in the East End of Pittsburgh. The middle school experience provides opportunity for tutoring in Japanese, French, or Spanish at Barack Obama Academy of International Studies. The high school or middle school experience invites advanced students, majors, or minors in Chinese, French, German, Japanese, or Spanish to work with language students and teachers at local schools. During the early weeks of the semester, students will meet to arrange their community outreach activities and prepare for their experience. Depending on the number of units to be earned, students will spend a certain number of hours per week engaged in some of the following activities: attending and participating in the individual and group meetings, working in the schools four to six hours per week, reading and preparing for their volunteer activities, keeping a journal of their experiences and responses to course readings, writing a paper or completing a project at the end of the term that reflects experiences. The final course grade will be based on the student's participation at the school site and fulfillment of the plan set at the beginning of the semester, participation in weekly on-campus discussions, weekly journal submissions, and final synthesis project. Prerequisites: Permission of the faculty liaison plus completion of an information sheet available in the Department of Modern Languages, and clearance forms available through the Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning and Outreach."

The second semester focuses particularly on more advanced skills in composition within a theatrical context. Through projects distributed throughout the semester students practice the skill-based techniques of music notation, orchestration, synthesis, sequencing, working with instrumentalists and the creation and utilization of sample-based instruments. This course will also cover textual analysis as it applies to both the inspiration for composition and to the more direct challenge of setting music to text."

The main focus will be on the narrative fiction film, but we will also discuss documentaries, avant-garde work and animation. At the same time, we will be attentive to the ways in which our conceptual understanding of film has impacted the development of successive waves of visual media. The central organizing principle is historical, but there are a number of recurring thematic concerns. These include an examination of the basic principles and terminology of filmmaking, the development of film technology, the definition of film as both art and business, the history of film as an object of critical and cultural study, and the importance of film as the precursor of newer formats. The course has four key goals. First, to provide students with a solid grounding in the key issues and concepts of film studies. Second, to expand their ability to knowledgeably critique individual cinematic works and the relationship of those works to the larger culture. Third to provide students with experience in expressing those critiques in verbal, written and visual forms. Lastly, to provide them with an understanding of the central role of film history and film studies in the development of newer media."

A variety of sections are offered in order to give students the opportunity to choose between different themes and approaches. All sections are comparable in their composition of lectures and recitations, required amounts of reading, and emphasis on written assignments as the central medium of assessment. The sections all aim to help students: (1) master knowledge through interaction with the instructors, reading material, and other students, (2) think critically about the context and purpose of any given information, (3) craft effective verbal and written arguments by combining evidence, logic, and creativity, and (4) appreciate the relevance of the past in the present and future.

In most cases, the goal should be to design and maintain a process which is in statistical control, producing with the \"best\" nominal value, and with a minimum of variation. How to determine what is \"best\" is a topic which we will also discuss; we will explore the use of the Taguchi Loss Function to help answer this question. We will also consider issues surrounding successful adoption of quality initiatives \u00bf finding ways of improving quality but being unable to get anyone to implement them is a prototypical problem in quality programs. We will then discuss strategies and tools which can be used to try to ensure quality; it is important to not only be familiar with the tools of quality design and control, but also to understand when and how they can best be correctly applied. In this area we will study three central topics \u00bf the first two, sampling and control charts, serve as a basis for the correct application and evaluation of the third, design of experiments. These central topics will be illustrated through exercises, experiments, and cases, culminating in a final interactive capstone case for the class. We will conclude with a discussion of six-sigma, exploring its similarities and differences as compared to traditional quality programs. At the conclusion of the course you will understand the six-sigma framework, and be comfortable with its technical tools. Other topics we will consider include process capability, setting tolerances, process control, quality in service operations, evaluatory techniques such as the House of Quality, and ISO 9000 certification. The goal of the course is not to indoctrinate students into any single quality assurance framework, but rather to teach them the techniques that are common, and central, to any effective quantitative quality design and maintenance program."

This course will test the current capabilities of the desktop 3D printer, and explore the ways in which it can be used to develop architectural massings and details. Through the iterative process, we will test your original designs at a number of scales, from site context to the building to the component. While there is no prerequisite for this course per se, it is expected that students understand the basic fundamentals of architectural drawing conventions (plans, sections, elevations), and/or are conversant in 3-D modeling programs (Sketchup, Revit, Rhino, etc). Preference will be given to those intending to graduate with a minor in Architecture."

The shoe purchase experience relies on system of services and products to satisfy one's needs and desires for new shoes. In this course, we will collectively define and study services and product service systems, and learn the basics of designing them. We will do this through lectures, studio projects, and verbal and written exposition. Classwork will be done individually and in teams.

Throughout the course, we will explore where people find medical information, how they use and evaluate it, and what challenges writers face in supporting informed healthcare decisions while communicating ideas that can be complex, provocative and sometimes frightening. We will read and discuss published literature dealing with issues in health literacy, clinical research, and patient care. We will also learn the basics of reading, understanding, and interpreting the research literature and communicating research findings to non-experts. Early in the semester, you'll choose a medical area of interest that you will research using sources such as journals, articles, books and web sites, as well as direct contact with appropriate medical, healthcare, and/or research professionals. For your final project, you will write and design materials that will meet a specific need or gap you identify in existing information. The final project could be a magazine article, a website, patient education material such as brochures or training materials, or another vehicle that emphasizes accurate, informative and engaging writing. In addition, there will be several short writing assignments to build the research and writing skills needed to effectively communicate healthcare information. A background in health, medicine or science is not necessary for this course, but a willingness to learn about these areas is essential."

Pundits and other observers have already generated a phenomenal amount of analysis and commentary about the 2012 election - and occasionally they have even been right. The goal in this class is to go beyond the spin and hyperbole of many election commentators and understand how voters decide and how strategists persuade. And, to give you some of the technical skills to get an interesting job with a campaign. This class will combine the insights of campaign professionals with insight from the study of previous campaigns and core academic knowledge. It will combine theory, practice, and exploration, taking the insights of political scientists and political practitioners and rolling them into one.

Through the internship, students gain professional experience and make long-lasting professional and personal contacts. In addition, students meet once a week with the CMU internship faculty for a 2-hour seminar to report and reflect on their internship experiences, and address pressing current issues from the perspective of their internship organization. In addition, the weekly seminar typically includes 1-2 CMU alumni from the Washington DC area whose personal and professional experiences become part of the seminar conversation, and who make themselves available to students as ongoing sources of information and advice.

            "desc": "76101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own. The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community. Each section of 76101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each student's individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

The first part of the course will focus on the ramifications of the conquest and colonization of the Americas, and specifically on the power of colonial narratives used to inscribe borders and frontiers in the colonial imagination\u2014to define \"civilization\" and \"barbarism,\" self and other. After a discussion of indigenous counter-narratives, we will move on to the second part of this course, an exploration of how what is now known as the southwestern United States and northern Mexico were transformed from borderlands into bordered lands, over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the final part of the course, we will move through and beyond the U.S.-Mexico border, to consider how \"border thinking\" helps to illuminate the frontiers of language, race, ethnicity, nationalism, and religion in the contemporary Americas."

Directors, designers, actors, and dramaturgs work in groups to generate original ideas, images, texts, and material in a workshop environment. These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations. The emphasis is on process, not product \u2014 devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development \u2014 both of which are explored here. We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included: Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more. Students learn to define and distinguish these artist's approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion. This class is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline. We focus on the process of creating a theatrical language which truly integrates disciplines."

This course, an introduction to the cultural study of law for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, can be seen as an introduction to what goes into the making of such a statement. Where do we get our ideas about law? What do we mean when we say \"law\"? What counts as law? How does culture influence law, and law, culture? And to what degree should historical context condition any answers we might be tempted to give? Students in the course will study works in a range of genres (novels, plays, poems, judicial opinions, pamphlets) and develop methods for investigating ways that law and culture have been made by one another from the 16th-century to the present. Readings will include influential theoretical accounts of law (Aristotle, Hobbes, Cover, Habermas, Bordieu, MacKinnon), canonical texts in Law and Literature (Shakespeare?s Measure for Measure, Melville?s Billy Budd, Kafka?s The Trial) and some \"weird fiction\" by the novelist/legal theorist China Mi\u00e9ville. As a counterpoint to the fiercely a historical \"law and economics\" movement, however, the course will put special emphasis on rooting intersections of law and culture in rich historical context, considering both local and international legal contexts (sometimes in fairly technical detail) alongside so-called \"ephemera\" of culture. Students will tackle the especially fruitful \"case\" of Renaissance Britain before developing final research projects, whether on the Renaissance or another period of their choosing."

The second half of the class will be dedicated to group projects that create \"story boards\" to explain in molecular terms how these experiments work. The story boards will be used by modelers at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to generate high-end animations of these experimental processes. This will prepare students for working in research labs and biology courses beyond \"Modern Biology\". This course is limited to first, second, and third year students."

The instruction will focus on a team approach to glassblowing, with an emphasis on safety, proper tool use, basic techniques, and materials. You?ll never drink from a glass again without appreciating what went into making it! This class is appropriate for students with limited or no hot shop experience. You may also wish to take this class a second time in order to continue to develop and refine basic skills before moving on to Hot II. The class fee includes 1 hour of open studio time per student (2 hours with a partner), so that students can become familiar with the studio and learn the simple process of studio rental outside of class hours. Each time you take it, you will gain confidence and skill as your passion for glass grows. Registration for Pittsburgh Glass Center classes can only be done on or after your scheduled registration day. Spaces are limited. Registration is done on a first come, first served basis. Please go to CFA 100 to register. Course fee is $287.50. Not eligible for PCHE Cross Registration. Course taught at the Pittsburgh Glass Center."

During the Cold War years, the United States intervened frequently in Latin America; following the Cold War, a new geopolitics emerged shaped by trade policies, immigration, and illicit drug trades. We will study relationships between U.S. and Latin American governments, but we will also consider many other kinds of people and institutions including artists, athletes, businessmen, coffee farmers, consumers, corporations, Hollywood studios, journalists, migrant workers, musicians, rebels, scientists, and tourists. We will learn about these people via readings, historical documents, film, music, and video."

Work for this course will include the introduction and use of more complicated sentence structures, grammar, and expressions. Students are also encouraged to communicate in longer sentences and write short paragraphs and essays in Chinese. Regular homework, quizzes, tests, and participation in class are mandatory (four in-class hours per week). Students will continue to learn the phonetic transcriptions of Chinese (Pinyin) for speaking and listening as well as Chinese characters for reading and writing. The elementary level is designed to help students learn to reflect and draw upon strategies used by good language learners in their second language study. A student with prior experience in Chinese must take the placement exam. Instructions for taking the placement exam are available in Baker Hall 160. Prerequisite: 82131 or 82133 or placement"

In addition to specific research methods and skills, we will cover issues that pertain to all research methods: How many people do I need to include in my study? How should I select them? Are my results valid? Is what I think I'm finding out reliable? What are the ethical issues in my study? We will use a combination of lecture, discussion, exercises and projects to achieve these objectives. This course will be useful for any student who is interested in learning more about methods that are widely used in professions such as designing/writing for new media, technical writing, science and healthcare communication, public & media relations, policy and non-profit communication."

With an eye to how changing theories of performativity have influenced how artists think about what it means to \"perform,\" this seminar, in a sense, will be engaged in both philosophical and aesthetic research about how technology has changed the conventions of performative artistic practice. What was the role of technology in the dematerialization of the object of art? How have ideas about virtual, parallel worlds changed the way artists think about the \"performing body?\" If technology once acted as a prosthetic device, increasing an artist's sensual and perceptual world, what happens to the role and impact of an artist's work in the seemingly inert realms of programming or the increasingly autonomous areas of Robotic Intelligence?"

For the purposes of this seminar, cultural studies includes history, politics, economics, art (painting, music, literature, film, photography), anthropology, religion, public heath, environmental history, and especially language. To understand Haiti today, it is necessary to know the island's troubled and often violent history. An example of the ravages of European colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade, Haiti's struggle for independence illustrates its people's resilience and determination. Through readings, documentaries, and interviews with current Haitians working to improve living conditions, students discover the paradoxes of the current country: a proud, immensely talented people struggling to help each other. Despite being cited as one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is managing to make slow progress despite political corruption, crippling natural disasters and often well-intentioned foreign aid that does little to improve the lives of average Haitians. Subjects covered in the seminar include: Haitian Creole; vodou (\"voodoo\"); international relations between Haiti and the United States, France, the Dominican Republic, and other pertinent countries; public health; foreign aid (especially following the January 2010 earthquake), environmental destruction and conservation; and education, particularly for children and young adults. Student work includes reading and reaction papers, film and documentary viewing and analysis, original research on a topic related to Haitian culture, oral presentations at different moments in the course, and a final project that includes research, an oral presentation and a final paper.

We begin by quickly reviewing number systems and digital arithmetic along with basic arithmetic circuits such as ripple-carry adders. We then focus on formal techniques and theory for analyzing the functionality, timing, power consumption, and chip area properties of these basic circuits and ones yet to be presented. From there, we move to more complex adders (carry-lookahead, carry-skip, carry_bypass, Wallace trees, and hybrid techniques) and multipliers (sequential, array, Booth, and others) along with various divider circuits. Floating point units are then built upon the concepts introduced for adder, multipliers, and dividers. Finally, we will investigate the design and implementation of digital filter circuits. For each circuit introduced, we will develop techniques for evaluating their functionality, their speed, power consumption, and silicon area requirements. In addition, we will utilize various CAD tools to design and evaluate most of the computation circuits discussed. After successful completion of the course, students will not only have an understanding of complex computation circuits, but subtle concepts that include hazards, metastability, false paths, inertial delay, sticky bits, clock skew/jitter, dynamic and static sensitization, and many others. 3 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec."

Yet, an esthetic and philosophical view of harmony with nature accompanies many forms of historical human activity in the built environment. Similarly, issues of waste removal, mechanical systems and natural materials that characterize current concerns have illustrative historical roots in numerous civilizations going back centuries and even millennia in pre-Industrial or non-industrial cultures. This course will engage texts and examples relating not simply architecture, landscape and urban history, but also art, philosophy and popular culture as a means to understand the many precedents for today?s interest in sustainable architecture and planning. The course will examine texts and works by figures including Vitruvius, Pliny, Leon Battista Alberti, Thomas Cole, Frederic Law Olmsted, Buckminster Fuller, Reyner Banham, Ebenezer Howard, Hassan Fathy, Bernard Rudofsky, Norman Foster, Robert Smithson, Andy Goldsworthy and more.

Students deconstruct existing pieces of communication design, studying how their composition, type and image usage, and hierarchy reflects the content being communicated and the order in which it is read. Working in print and digital media, students study the similarities and differences among mediums and explore methods for effectively communicating information in each area. Students analyze design examples from the perspective of the maker and the receiver(s).

The application will be partitioned between human computer interaction, electronics, industrial design, mechanical, and software components. The class will be divided into groups to specify, design, and implement the various subsystems. The goal is to produce a working hardware/software prototype of the system and to evaluate the user acceptability of the system. We will also monitor our progress in the design process by capturing our design escapes (errors) with the Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC). Upon completion of this course the student will be able to: generate systems specifications from a perceived need; partition functionality between hardware and software; produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems; use computer-aided design tools; fabricate, integrate, and debug a hardware/software system; and evaluate the system in the context of an end user application.

After an introduction to the fundamental principles of water treatment technologies, students will identify present day technology shortcomings and distill these into discrete design objectives. Students will then formulate and answer quantitative and qualitative questions that respond to these design objectives by leveraging their knowledge of engineering fundamentals, regulatory tools, and pricing policies. Comparing their own solutions with those proposed in the peer-reviewed academic literature in engineering and the social sciences, students will evaluate the technical feasibility, usability, and social desirability of proposed water innovations in developed and developing countries and summarize their findings in policy briefs."

In the past this might have been called Public Art, but today new strategies are being used that challenge public art's tradition of static sculptures and embrace more dynamic forms of public engagement. As its name implies, Contextual Practice embraces the context or social conditions in which an artwork exists as part of the material of that work. Evolving out of the history of site-specific, conceptual, and performance art practices, Contextual Practice covers a range of exciting new methods to making art in the public including street art, interactive social media, environmental art, hacktivism, participatory art, guerilla performance, project-based community art, and urban interventions. Students in this field-based class will create projects that work with the social dynamics of a variety of on and off-campus and online public contexts. We will research new trends in public engagement through art, architecture, and design, as well as politics, ecology, sociology, and economics. Fundamentally, this class asks students to experiment with how their art practice can intersect directly with the real world (outside of the traditional art venues) and how they can proactively create new sites and audiences for their work."

The course will present this material through two paths. Lectures will be presented on the basic unit processes of micro and nanosystems fabrication: deposition, patterning, and etching. Lectures will draw on examples from: Semiconductor device fabrication; Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication; Magnetic device fabrication, and; Optical device fabrication. Problem sets will be given based on this lecture material to allow students to quantitatively analyze certain process steps in detail. The second path for material presentation will be through a series of labs that allow students to design, fabricate and test an integrated device. These laboratories will be scheduled at regular meeting times, and will use research facilities within the ECE Department. This is a PhD level course. MS or senior students must obtain permission from the instructor to be registered."

It might be said that no other class of artist dominates Los Angeles as much as show runners do. They move from one of their creations to another, often delivering material quite different in tone from one show to the next, but, if one digs deep, clearly originating from the same voice. This class will examine the work of a handful of show runners, spanning broadcast TV from the 80's (Steven Bochco & David Milch) to modern day (Ryan Murphy, Bryan Fuller, Bruno Heller, Shonda Rhimes, Barbara Hall). By contrasting their own work examples to each other, and then their work to other show runners, we'll come to a deeper understanding of the television art form.

That is, it marks a period in European history that was not quite medieval, and yet not quite modern. Many features of modern society, such as the nation-state, free-trade economies, religious pluralism, scientific rationalism, and secular culture trace their origins to the early modern era, yet the period was also marked by important continuities with the Middle Ages. During this course, we will explore how Europeans re-imagined their world in its transition from the medieval to the modern. Topics to be considered will include the \"renaissance\" of the arts, the problems of religious reform, exploration and colonialism, the rise of science, and the expansion of the state. Through these developments, we will focus on Europeans' changing notions of the human body, the body politic, and the natural world, as well as their re-interpretations of the proper relation between the human and the divine, the individual and the community, and the present and the past."

We will begin with the 18th-century plantation \"overseer,\" who was charged with ensuring the productivity and obedience of slaves under his watch. We will then move on to explore the emergence of commercial surveillance in the 19th century, which sought to gather intelligence on the credit worthiness and moral worthiness of businessmen in a rapidly growing, and increasingly impersonal, economy. Next, we will examine the shifting focus of surveillance from the late 19th century to the present, as it expanded from immigrants and criminals to include industrial workers, political radicals, civil rights activists (most notably Martin Luther King), the poor, and ultimately, all of us. Today, anyone who has a cell phone in their pocket, surfs the Internet, keeps up with friends through social networks, makes purchases with a credit card, uses membership cards, travels, or even just spends time in public spaces ought to assume that their movements, purchasing habits, communication metadata, social connections, and Internet browsing histories are being recorded, stored and analyzed for a variety of governmental and commercial purposes. In the final week of the course, we will debate the implications of these incursions into our public and private lives."

Throughout the semester students will explore the materials and equipment used by all kinds of professionals in the fabrication industry. Through this exploration students will become conversant with the kinds of properties, and the advantages and disadvantages of many different items. Along with this exploration is a concurrent investigation of entertainment industry accidents. This material is valuable in how it contextualizes the kind of work students will be involved in, and helps to drive home the very real consequences of errors pertaining to scenery. In the classroom and in lab students in this course will develop their knowledge and processes for building scenery. The course has three basic units. The beginning of the semester focuses on building materials and on tool use. Through the center of the semester course material focuses on traditional scenery practices. The end of the semester material addresses rigging systems and scenery rigging practices. Laboratory assignments tied to this course will consist of carpentry assignments in the shop and carpentry and rigging assignments during load in. Occasionally students pursuing a more customized path may have lab assignments in the paint department in the shop and in the electrics department during install. All students may receive apprentice assignments in the scenery office."

Some of the more specific questions we address: Because humans possess free will and act with intentions while light rays and planets in motion do not, are we forced to use logically different species of explanations in the two cases? How can we explain social institutions that depend upon cooperation? Whereas natural scientists actively conduct experiments, social scientists can often only collect statistical data.

            "desc": "In classical rhetoric, \"style\" is a term that refers not to what we write but how we write. Yet considerations about how we write ? coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance ? can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, \"Who is my audience\"? and \"What is my purpose\"? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising writing. Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved ?good? style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers? Course Website: http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/index.html"

            "desc": "In English and many other languages, it is possible to express the same content in several different, but closely related ways. For example, the following sentences all seem to have the same content: \"John saw Mary\"; \"Mary was seen by John\"; \"It was John who saw Mary\"; \"John, he saw Mary\". Yet the sentences are not interchangeable in discourse. Sentences can also be differentiated by intonation: in the sentence John saw Mary, any of the three words can be emphasized, and these changes in emphasis have consequences for what the sentence expresses. In this course, we will develop the view that these syntactic and intonational manipulations carry information about whether information is being presented as new or old, novel or familiar, foregrounded or backgrounded, and about how the content presented is connected to ongoing discourse. In the course, students will learn the methodology for exploring the discourse functions of different constructions, and skills and concepts to use in describing these functions. At the same time, we will need to fully grasp the syntactic properties of the sentence-types in question. Syntactic analyses will build on the syntax developed in 80180 Nature of Language and additional courses covering syntax (depending on the experience of the participants)."
